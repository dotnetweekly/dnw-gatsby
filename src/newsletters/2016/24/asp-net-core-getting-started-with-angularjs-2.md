Last year I wrote an article about “<a href="http://proudmonkey.azurewebsites.net/asp-net-5-jump-start-to-angularjs-with-mvc-6-web-api/">ASP.NET 5: Jump Start to AngularJS with MVC 6 Web API</a>”. This article will walk you through on how to get started with AngularJS 2 in ASP.NET Core (a.k.a ASP.NET 5). In this article you will basically learn how to set up the required tools needed for you to run a simple Angular 2 App within ASP.NET Core. By simple, I mean there’s no database or data model involved as I’m trying to keep this article as simple as possible so starters can easily follow. In my next article, I'll demonstrate how to build an app that uses ASP.NET Core Web API to work with data, but at this point we’ll just start with the basics first.
