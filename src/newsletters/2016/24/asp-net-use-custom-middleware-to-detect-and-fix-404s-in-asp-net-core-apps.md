If you’ve ever lost something at a school or an amusement park, you may have had the good fortune of getting it back by checking the location’s Lost and Found. In Web applications, users frequently make requests for paths that aren’t handled by the server, resulting in 404 Not Found response codes (and occasionally humorous pages explaining the problem to the user).
