In my last two articles, “Logging with .NET Core” (<a href="http://msdn.com/magazine/mt694089">msdn.com/magazine/mt694089</a>), and, “Configuration in .NET Core” (<a href="http://msdn.com/magazine/mt632279">msdn.com/magazine/mt632279</a>), I demonstrated how .NET Core functionality can be leveraged from both an ASP.NET Core project (project.json) and the more common .NET 4.6 C# project (*.csproj). In other words, taking advantage of the new framework isn’t limited to those who are writing ASP.NET Core projects. In this column I’m going to continue to delve into .NET Core, with a focus on .NET Core dependency injection (DI) capabilities and how they enable an inversion of control (IoC) pattern.
