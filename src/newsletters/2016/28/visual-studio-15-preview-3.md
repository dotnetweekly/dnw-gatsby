Today I am happy to share <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=746567">Visual Studio “15” Preview 3</a> (which is different from Visual Studio 2015 Update 3). This is still a Preview and is unsupported, so my recommendation is to not install it on your production environments. That said, it should install right on top of any previous Visual Studio “15” Previews and side by side with previous versions of Visual Studio. Here are the <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/news/releasenotes/vs15-relnotes">Visual Studio “15” Preview Release Notes</a>, and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vs-knownissues/vs15-preview3">Visual Studio “15” Preview 3 Known Issues</a>.
