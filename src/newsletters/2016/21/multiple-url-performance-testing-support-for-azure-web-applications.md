<a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/visualstudioalm/2015/09/15/announcing-public-preview-for-performanceload-testing-of-azure-webapp/">Performance/load testing of Azure web applications</a> is supported for a while, today we are announcing support for multiple URLs performance testing using Visual Studio web test format.Â Typically web application includes multiple web pages with headers and query parameters, so currently user has to create multiple test runs in Azure portal for testing each of these pages. We have been getting feedback to support multiple web pages in a single performance test run. With the latest update, you can now simulate a user scenario with multiple URLs and performance test your web application fully.
