With the release of ASP.NET Core RC2, Microsoft hit a major milestone. But this change isn’t a trivial one. It’s a big change. Since I’m updating my <a href="http://shawnw.me/learnaspnetcore" target="_blank">Pluralsight course on ASP.NET Core</a>, I wanted to get a list of changes for the new version. I figured I’d share all the changes I could find converting a stock RC1 project to a RC2 one. It’s a big list, but hopefully manageable. Please share in comments and changes I missed so others can be helped!
