I don't know about you, but I found it pretty hard to get into the Code Lab sessions at Build 2016. I loved the idea (a "lab" with already setup PC's and development environments, etc.), but life is too short to wait in line an hour+ before the given session.

Luckily all the content, instructions, setup and source is all available now in the Microsoft-Build-2016 repo!
