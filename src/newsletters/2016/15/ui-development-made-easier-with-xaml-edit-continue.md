Making UI is easy. Making GREAT UI can be a bit trickier. Visual Studio wants to be the best in class tool for designing good user experiences. We have been spending a lot of our time looking at the challenges you face, learning from them, and being inspired by watching you try to solve UI problems. As a result, we have made some improvements to Visual Studio tools in both <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691129">Visual Studio 2015 Update 2</a> and <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/visual-studio-next-downloads-vs">Visual Studio “15” Preview</a>, and we are excited to see what you think of them.
