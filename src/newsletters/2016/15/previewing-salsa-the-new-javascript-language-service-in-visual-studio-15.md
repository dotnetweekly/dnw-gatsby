The new JavaScript language service, codenamed “Salsa”, is now available in Visual Studio “15” Preview. Language services are responsible for providing syntax highlighting, completion lists, signature help, and other tooling features for a specific language inside the IDE. Salsa delivers many improvements over the existing JavaScript language service such as improved module support, full ES6/ES7 syntax coverage, and JSX support.
