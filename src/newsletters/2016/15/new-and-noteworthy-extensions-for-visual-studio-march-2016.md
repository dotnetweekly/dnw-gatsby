It was great to see the excitement around <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/2016/03/02/new-noteworthy-visual-studio-extensions-feburary-2016/?wt.mc_id=o~msft~vsblog~insideEcoMar2016">last month’s post</a> and I heard from many of you that you have discovered some new extensions. March has been another great month for the Visual Studio ecosystem. We added over 100 extensions to the <a href="https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/">Visual Studio Gallery</a>. To help you enjoy this creativity from the community, every month or two I’ll be introducing some of the new extensions that caught my eye.
