Throughout history, the ability to simulate has aided the development of multiple sciences. Medical models simulating the human body enhance the study of human anatomy. Computer simulation games such as “World of Warcraft” recreate an entire fantasy world and “Flight Simulator” helps train pilots on the ground. Various simulation programs explore responses to terrorist attacks, pandemic diseases and other possible crises. Even the simulated dinosaurs in the film “Jurassic Park” hint at the broad application of simulation and its potential.
