Whether you're an accomplished developer or starting to understand the ways of C++, Andrey's book, "The Ultimate Question of Programming, Refactoring, and Everything," which is available in full at <a href="http://www.viva64.com/en/b/0391/" target="_blank">http://www.viva64.com/en/b/0391/</a>, is a great place to brush up or learn something new.
