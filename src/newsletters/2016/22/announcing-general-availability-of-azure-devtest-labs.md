Today, we are very excited to announce the general availability of <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devtest-lab/">Azure DevTest Labs</a>: your self-service sandbox environment in Azure to quickly create Dev/Test environments while minimizing waste and controlling costs. We’ve been hearing from a lot of customers about all kinds of challenges they’ve been facing in their Dev/Test environments. With the power of cloud, some problems have started being solved such as the hardware maintenance cost.
