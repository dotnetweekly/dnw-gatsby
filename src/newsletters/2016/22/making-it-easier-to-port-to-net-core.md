In my last post, I <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/02/10/porting-to-net-core/">talked about porting to .NET Core</a> and requested feedback from our community on what their experience was and what we could improve. This sparked many great conversations with our users. Based on these conversations as well as our experience working with first- and third-party partners, we’ve decided to drastically simplify the porting effort by unifying the core APIs with other .NET platforms, specifically the .NET Framework and Mono/Xamarin. In this blog post, I’ll talk about our plans, how and when this work will happen, and what this means for existing .NET Core customers.
