ASP.NET Core 1.0 is a complete rewrite of ASP.NET, and one of the main goals for this new framework is a more modular design. That is, apps should be able to leverage only those parts of the framework they need, with the framework providing dependencies as they’re requested. Further, developers building apps using ASP.NET Core should be able to leverage this same functionality to keep their apps loosely coupled and modular. With ASP.NET MVC, the ASP.NET team greatly improved the framework’s support for writing loosely coupled code, but it was still very easy to fall into the trap of tight coupling, especially in controller classes.
