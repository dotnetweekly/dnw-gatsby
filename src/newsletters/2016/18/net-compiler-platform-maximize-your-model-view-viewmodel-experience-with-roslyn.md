Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) is a very popular architectural pattern that works perfectly with XAML application platforms such as Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) and the Universal Windows Platform (UWP). Architecting an application using MVVM provides, among many others, the benefit of clean separation between the data, the application logic and the UI. This makes applications easier to maintain and test, improves code re-use and enables designers to work against the UI without interacting with the logic or the data. Over the years, a number of libraries, project templates, and frameworks, such as Prism and the MVVM Light Toolkit, have been built to help developers implement MVVM more easily and efficiently. However, in some situations, you canâ€™t rely on external libraries, or you might simply want to be able to implement the pattern quickly while keeping focus on your code.
