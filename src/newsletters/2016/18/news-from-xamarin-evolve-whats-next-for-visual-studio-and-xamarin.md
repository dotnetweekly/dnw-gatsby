Less than a month ago, at //BUILD, we announced the integration of Xamarin technology into our Visual Studio product line, furthering our Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform approach and bringing even more power and productivity to the nearly 13 million devs who have already downloaded Visual Studio 2015 and the 10 million who have downloaded Visual Studio Community 2015. This integration provides Visual Studio users (like you :)) great additional value to create beautiful and highly performant native Android, iOS and Windows apps, at no additional cost. The combination of the existing Microsoft product portfolio with Xamarin technology creates an end-to-end solution for every stage of the mobile development lifecycle. We can’t wait to see what you deliver!
