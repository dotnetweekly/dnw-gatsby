In last month's column I showed <a href="https://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2016/02/01/[January%202015%20Practical%20TypeScript%20Column:%20Exploiting%20TypeScript%20Arrays]" target="_blank">how to declare and use TypeScript arrays</a>. As I mentioned in that column, in many ways it's better to think of TypeScript arrays as dictionaries: Collections whose values can be accessed by providing a key value. It's just that, with arrays, the keys are always numeric values.
