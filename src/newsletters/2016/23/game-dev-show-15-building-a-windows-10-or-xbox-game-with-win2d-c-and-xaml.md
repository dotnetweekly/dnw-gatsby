In this episode of the Game Dev Show, I introduce you to Win2D – a powerful and easy-to-use Open Source library for immediate mode 2D graphics rendering with GPU acceleration. It is available to C# and C++ developers writing Universal apps and games for Windows 10 (UWP) - including Xbox One - and also Windows Runtime apps for Windows &amp; Windows Phone 8.1. It utilizes the power of Direct2D, and integrates seamlessly with XAML and CoreWindow.
