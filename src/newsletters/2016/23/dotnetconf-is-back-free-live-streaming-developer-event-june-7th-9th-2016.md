.NET plays an important role in the lives of many Visual Studio developers, I for one have worked on many ASP.NET, WPF Desktop and other back-end .NET services over the years in my career and therefore its really exciting for me to be part of the team to bring you yet another dotnetConf, back again and streaming live this week (and for free, with no need to register)!
