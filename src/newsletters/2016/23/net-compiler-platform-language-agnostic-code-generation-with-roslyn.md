The Roslyn code base providespowerful APIs you can leverage to perform rich code analysis over your source code. For instance, analyzers and code refactorings can walk through a piece of source code and replace one or more syntax nodes with new code you generate with the Roslyn APIs. A common way to perform code generation is via the SyntaxFactory class, which exposes factory methods to generate syntax nodes in a way that compilers can understand. The SyntaxFactory class is certainly very powerful because it allows generating any possible syntax element, but there are two different SyntaxFactory implementations: Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp.SyntaxFactory and Microsoft.CodeÂ­Analysis.VisualBasic.SyntaxFactory.
