.NET Core RC2 and ASP.NET Core RC2 released just a couple of weeks back. They feature the introduction of the .NET CLI, major changes to the .NET Core SDK (formerly called DNX), the rebranding of ASP.NET 5 to ASP.NET Core, and more. You can read about these on the <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/05/16/announcing-net-core-rc2/">.NET team blog</a> and the <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/webdev/2016/05/16/announcing-asp-net-core-rc2/">.NET Web Development team blog</a>.Â We are now pleased to announce MSTest framework support for these releases! The framework and its allied packages are available on NuGet now. This is a preview release, and we are looking for your feedback to make this a robust rollout for RTM.
