The technology formerly known as Entity Framework 7 (EF7) was renamed to Entity Framework Core (EF Core) in early 2016. EF Core 1.0.0 introduces some great new capabilities, though overall it does have a smaller feature set than EF6. But this doesn’t mean EF runs only on .NET Core. You can use EF Core in APIs and applications that require the full .NET Framework, as well as those that target only the cross-platform .NET Core. In this column, I’ll walk you through two projects that explore these options. My goal is to alleviate any worries the “Core” moniker might imply: that EF Core only runs on .NET Core. At the same time, I’ll explain the steps involved in creating each solution.
