Today we released <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/visual-studio-pre-release-downloads/">Visual Studio “15” Preview 5</a>. With this Preview, I want to focus mostly on performance improvements, and in the coming days we’ll have some follow-up posts about the performance gains we’ve seen. I’m also going to point out some of the productivity enhancements we’ve made.
