Far more than any other app platform, the Universal Windows Platform (UWP) supports a vast range of background activities. If these were allowed to compete for resources in an uncontrolled manner, it would degrade the foreground experience to an unacceptable level. All concurrent processes compete for system resourcesâ€”memory, CPU, GPU, disk and network I/O, and so on. The system Resource Manager encapsulates rules for arbitrating this contention, and the two most important mechanisms are memory limits and task priorities.
