One of the most important tools for a programmer is an IDE. Sure, we can use a text editor (Notepad, Vim or Emacs to name a few), but realistically it is difficult to work on a modern project without the help provided by IDE: IntelliSense, support for build automation and test frameworks, debugger, version control tools and many more. In my current project frontend developers are using WebStorm form JetBrains.
