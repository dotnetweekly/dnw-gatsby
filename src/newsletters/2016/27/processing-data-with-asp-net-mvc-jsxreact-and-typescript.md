Obviously, I think the combination of JSX, React and TypeScript is cool. I showed how to create a simple "Hello, World" Typescript/JSX+React Web page in a<a href="https://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2016/04/25/eliminate-barrier-javascript-html.aspx" target="_blank">previous column</a> (that included showing how to configure an ASP.NET MVC project with TypeScript and React). In my <a href="https://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2016/05/16/typescript-class-with-csharp.aspx" target="_blank">last column</a>, I went one step further and showed how to integrate a read-only form with ASP.NET MVC. This column builds on that to show how to both accept in that form and how to make AJAX calls back to an Action method in that MVC application.
