.NET Core and ASP.NET Core 1.0 are finally here, and in this post I'll show how to get started with these new tools using the command line tooling. This is not meant to be your typical getting started tutorial that jumps right into Visual Studio and creates a Web project from there. Rather, the purpose of this post is to demonstrate some of the core underpinnings of how .NET Core and ASP.NET Core projects are bootstrapped and using the command line tooling is actually the best way to demonstrate this.
