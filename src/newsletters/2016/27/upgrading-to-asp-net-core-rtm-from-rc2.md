ASP.NET Core RTM is finally here.A big congratulation to the .NET Core and ASP.NET teams for getting this massive piece of software into our hands in release mode. It's been a long and challenging road, but looking where we've landed and where it appears where we're heading with .NET Core, I think it was well worth the wait and tribulations.
