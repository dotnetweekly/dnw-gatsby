Extensions enable publishers (partners, customers, developers) to create first-class, integrated experiences within Visual Studio Team Services. They enable integration at the UI layer â€“ surfacing the relevant information in the right places and streamlining the user experience. An Extension can be a simple context menu, toolbar action or can be a complex and powerful custom user experience that lights up within the account, collection, or project hubs.
