Exciting news! Starting today, SQL Server 2014 Developer Edition is now a <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/products/visual-studio-dev-essentials-vs?wt.mc_id=WW_CE_BD_OO_SCL_TW_DESQLBenefitAnnouncement_SQL">free download for Visual Studio Dev Essentials members</a>. We are making this change so that all developers can leverage the capabilities that SQL Server 2014 has to offer for their data solution, and this is another step in making SQL Server more accessible. SQL Server Developer Edition is for development and testing only, and not for production environments or for use with production data.
