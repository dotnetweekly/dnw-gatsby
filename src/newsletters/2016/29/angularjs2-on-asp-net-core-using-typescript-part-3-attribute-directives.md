Previously we started creating our seed project then we created our first AngularJS2 app, on this post we will try to play with AngularJs2â€™s Attribute Directives.

Basically, Attribute Directives allows us to change the appearance or behavior of a DOM Element, such us changing colors of DIVS when our mouse enters or exits, or alter the behavior of a DOM element when clicking them.
