It has been about two weeks since we shipped .NET Core / ASP.NET Core 1.0. The team has used the past two weeks to take a deep breath, and is now getting started on planning what is coming next. We have seen a lot of .NET Core SDK downloads and significant feedback. Please keep the feedback coming.
