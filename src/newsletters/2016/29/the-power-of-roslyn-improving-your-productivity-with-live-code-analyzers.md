Two years ago we open sourced the C# and Visual Basic compilers and exposed their functionality through APIs as the Roslyn project. The Roslyn analyzer API empowers the developer community to be more productive by lighting up their own features in the editor in real-timeâ€”meaning anyone can write a refactoring, code fix, code style rule, or code diagnostic. Come learn more about the Roslyn project and what these live analyzers mean for you and your productivity.
