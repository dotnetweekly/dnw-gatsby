I've lately been feeling my way around getting an actual, production-ready<a href="http://www.asp.net/core">ASP.NET Core</a> app developed, and one of the features I've really been digging (one of <a href="https://www.exceptionnotfound.net/tag/asp.net-core-1.0/">many</a>) is native support for Dependency Injection (DI). DI is huge in modern web apps, so making it the default for ASP.NET Core applications is, IMO, a big step forward for this framework.
