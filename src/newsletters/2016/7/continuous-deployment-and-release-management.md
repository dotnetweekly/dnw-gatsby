This session discusses the benefits and demonstrates Continuous Deployment and Release Management. Continuous Deployment, which usually comes after Continuous Integration (CI), is the ability to use the output from CI and deploy this new known good build to an environment automatically. The session also covers Release Management, which is the way to mature Continuous Deployment from just one environment to the rest of the environments in your pipeline.
