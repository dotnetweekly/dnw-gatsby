Today, we are releasing a set of reliability and quality updates for .NET Core 1.0. The quickest way to get the updates is to head over to dot.net/core and follow the updated install instructions for your operating system. You can download and install the update as an MSI for Windows, a PKG for macOS and updated zips and packages for Linux OSes. If you donâ€™t yet have .NET Core, you can start with this release. It contains everything you need to get started.
