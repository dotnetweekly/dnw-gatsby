Scott talks to Piyush Joshi about how you can use Azure Mobile Engagement and capture information and events about how users user your mobile apps. You can then take this big data collection and process it to better understand WHY users do what they do and come up with specific ways you can improve a user's experience and engage with your audience more deeply.
