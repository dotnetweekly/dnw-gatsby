Microsoft Flow—the software giant’s answer to IFTTT—is now available, following about six months in beta.

Flow is a new cloud-based service that helps you automate tasks and business processes across multiple applications and services, such as Dropbox, Facebook, Twitter, and many others, plus Microsoft solutions like Outlook, Excel, Office 365, Onedrive and more.
