Once again, it is the time of the year when we have the privilege to host thousands of passionate technical leaders for our MVP Global Summit. This is far from a traditional technical conference. Next week our whole Redmond campus is dedicated to over 2,000 MVPs. Across 16 buildings and 55 of our largest meeting spaces, MVPs will attend over 620 deeply technical sessions, roundtables and networking opportunities with our Product Groups.
