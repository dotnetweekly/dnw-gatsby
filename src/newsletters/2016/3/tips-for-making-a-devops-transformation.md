Nordstrom is regarded by many to represent the pinnacle of customer service. Many factors contribute to this stellar reputation... one is their IT Dept's commitment to doings things differently with greater agility. We're happy to have Courtney Kissler and Rob Cummings in studio to share their perspective on how DevOps has helped them be as agile as possible to uphold that great front end customer service on the backend.
