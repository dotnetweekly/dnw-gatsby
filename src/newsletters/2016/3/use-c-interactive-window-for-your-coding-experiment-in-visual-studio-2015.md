The <strong>Interactive Window</strong> in <a href="http://dailydotnettips.com/" target="_blank">Visual Studio</a> is a great utility to <em>play around the code, language features, API’s and other .NET framework features</em>. It is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop" target="_blank">REPL</a>  (<em>Read–eval–print loop</em>) that provides us an environment for live coding and evaluate expression or code snippet based on our inputs. The <strong>Interactive Window</strong> also support features like <em>IntelliSense</em>, <em>syntax highlighting</em> and <em>navigating through executed commands. </em>
