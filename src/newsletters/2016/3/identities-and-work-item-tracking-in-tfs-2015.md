In Team Foundation Server 2015 we introduced identity fields which made significant changes to how the Work Item Tracking (WIT) system handles identity values. These changes help modernize the underlying system and provide support for upcoming features . However, the changes result in API and data format differences that TFS users (especially those writing third-party tools with ClientOM or REST) need to be aware of.
