Just in case you missed it, .NET is all open source now and .NET Core is a free, open source, cross-platform framework that you can download and start with in &lt;10 minutes. You can get it on Mac, Windows, and a half-dozen Unixes at <a href="http://dot.net/">http://dot.net</a>. Take that along with the free, cross-platform <a href="http://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> and you'll be writing C# and F# all over the place.
