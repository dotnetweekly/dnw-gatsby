Industry analyst Ben Kepes provides insights on how integrating DevOps practices enables organizations to deliver business outcomes more rapidly. He discusses how DevOps is more about culture and communication than technology aloneâ€”and how to foster a culture across an organization that supports agility and innovation. He explains how agility can be further enhanced by a heterogeneous development environment, automation tools, and a cloud infrastructure. He ends by taking a look at the current and future state of DevOps and recommends steps an organization can take to become more agile.
