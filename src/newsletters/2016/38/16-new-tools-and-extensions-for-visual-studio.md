The summer may be coming to an unwelcome end -- except to those of us looking forward to fall colors and skiing -- but there's been no let up in the release of new tools and extensions for Visual Studio. That includes the first trickle of extensions specifically for the upcoming Visual Studio 15. I've pulled together a round-up of 16 new contributions to the <a href="https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/" target="_blank">Visual Studio Gallery</a> that range from project templates to security toolsets to simple utilities that make you more productive. Bonus: They're all free.
