Welcome to The Xamarin Show, your weekly native cross-platform mobile development show with your host <a title="James on Channel 9" href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Niners/JamesMontemagno" target="_blank">James Montemagno</a>. Each week join James and his guests as they discuss building mobiles apps, integrating SDKs, extending mobile apps, the latest Xamarin news, awesome apps developers are building, and so much more. On this weeks episode we take a look at how to share code across iOS, Android, and all of the Windows platforms. There are many strategies to help share code across a single application or across several applications and we explore all of them!
