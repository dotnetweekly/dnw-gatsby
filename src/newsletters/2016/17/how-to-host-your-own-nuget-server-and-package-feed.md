Hosting your own NuGet Server, particularly when you're a company or even a small workgroup is a super useful thing. It's a great way to ensure that the build artifacts of each team are NuGet Packages and that other teams are consuming those packages, rather than loose DLLs.Â A lot of folks (myself included a minute ago) don't realize <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms.feed">that Visual Studio Team Services also offers private NuGet Feeds for your team</a> so that's pretty sweet. But I wanted to try out was setting up my own quick NuGet Server. I could put it on a web server in my closet or up in Azure.
