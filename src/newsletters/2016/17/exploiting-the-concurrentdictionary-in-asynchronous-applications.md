In an <a href="https://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2016/03/01/sharing-information-between-asynchronous-processes.aspx" target="_blank">earlier column</a> I introduced the ConcurrentDictionary object, which allows you to share data between asynchronous processes. In that column, I showed how to use the basic TryAdd and TryGetValue methods. Those methods work well, provided you have a simple application with one process adding or removing items and all other processes reading items in the dictionary (the producer/consumers pattern).
