Last week we released an update to the <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/visualstudio/2016/04/11/whats-new-in-vs-2015-update-2-for-universal-windows-developers/" target="_blank">Visual Studio 2015 Tools for Universal Windows Apps (UWA)</a>. The release includes improvements across the libraries, runtime, and compiler. This means that development is faster and applications will be more responsive and easier to maintain. Applications such as <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/apps/ncaa-march-madness-live/9wzdncrfjcmh" target="_blank">NCAA March Madness Live</a> and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/apps/tunein-radio/9wzdncrfj3sf" target="_blank">TuneIn Radio</a> are already available in the Store built using our new .NET Native tools!
