In this video, I had the chance to have a look at some more advanced implementations ASP.NET Core's new policy authorization model with Microsoft's crack security analyst Barry Dorrans (emphasis crack). I learned how to configure ASP.NET Core in more realistic scenarios to authorize access to web applications using code instead of just the presence of a role. We configured a web application to properly grant access to alcohol sales dependent on the country and their minimum age laws. I also discovered how to handle credentials like our security teams do at the office: accepting not just my company id, but also temporary ids and guest ids. I now know everything there is to know about ASP.NET Core Security and am ready to secure my next web application.
