This week, James is joined by friend of the show <a title="" href="http://twitter.com/praeclarum">Frank Krueger</a>, independent app developer, who shows us <a title="" href="http://continuous.codes/">Continuous, a Professional C# &amp; F# IDE</a> for iPad, that Frank developers in F# with Xamarin. Continuous enables any developer to write full Xamarin.iOS and Xamarin.Forms applications interactively with a live REPL that is always debugging your code. Continuous works with C# and F# to build not only applications, but libraries and scripts that can easily be exported. Frank talks about his inspiration for Continuous, open source technology that enabled the creation of Continuous, and to get started using Continuous with some live coding.
