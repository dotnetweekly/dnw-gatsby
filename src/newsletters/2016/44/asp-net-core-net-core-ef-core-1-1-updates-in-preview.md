A number of significant changes are coming to an incremental update for ASP.NET Core 1.1, which can be tested out in the initial preview release being rolled out this week. Highlights among the laundry list of changes is the addition of several middleware component for URL rewriting, response caching and compression, MVC filters, and providers for Azure App Service logging and Azure Key Vault. .NET Core is also being released, but with less ambitious plans.
