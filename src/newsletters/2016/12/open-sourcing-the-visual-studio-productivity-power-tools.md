We’re excited to announce that we’re open-sourcing the <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/VS-PPT">Visual Studio Productivity Power Tools on GitHub</a>. Productivity Power Tools, first released in 2010, is a pack of powerful extensions to improve developer productivity including <em>Ctrl+Click Go to Definition</em>, <em>Copy As HTML,</em> and <em>Middle Click Scroll</em>, just to name a few. Since their introduction, these tools have been updated for every major Visual Studio release, and a number of features that started out as part of the Productivity Power Tools are now core features of Visual Studio. Making the current set of tools available to the community is important to us, and we hope it will also inspire developers with concrete examples of what can be achieved with extensions of their own.
