The word template in web programming makes one think of a reusable document or string you can combine with model data to produce output. Famous examples include Razor, Jade, and Handlebars. Template literals in JavaScript are not templates in this same sense, which is perhaps why they were originally referred to as quasi-literals in early specification work.
