Cross site request forgery is one of those attacks which remains enormously effective yet is frequently misunderstood. I’ve been running a bunch of security workshops for web developers around the globe recently and this is one of the topics we cover that often results in blank stares when I first ask about it. It usually unfolds that the developers have multiple resources at risk of a CSRF attack and if it’s not a classic web form style resource, then it’s frequently an API somewhere (you’re passing anti-forgery tokens to any APIs you wouldn’t want fraudulently called, right?!)
