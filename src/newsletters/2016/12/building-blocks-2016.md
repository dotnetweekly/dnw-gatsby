If you’re a cutting-edge developer—or you’d like to be—check out this series of Building Blocks interviews with popular experts, like Jon Galloway and Andy Wigley. These six interviews take place over three days, just two hours per day, so you can get all your questions answered. They are designed to help developers explore the latest and most exciting technologies and to show you what you can look forward to at this year’s <a href="https://build.microsoft.com/" target="_blank">//build</a> conference.
