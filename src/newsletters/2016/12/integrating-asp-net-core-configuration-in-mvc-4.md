The biggest benefit of this new configuration system is that it’s not based on System.Configuration or web.config. Instead, it pulls from an ordered set of configuration providers that support a variety of file formats (such as XML and JSON) as well as environment variables. If one of the built-in configuration providers doesn’t meet your needs, you can write your own.
