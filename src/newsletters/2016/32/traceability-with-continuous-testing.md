With the deployment of Sprint 103, we are enabling users to track the quality of their Requirements right on theÂ Dashboard. We already have a solution for Requirements quality for our Planned testing users and we are bringing it to our users who follow Continuous Testing. Users will be able to link automated tests directly to Requirements and then use Dashboard widgets to track the quality of Requirements you are interested in tracking, pulling the Quality data from Build or Release. This feature will work for tests written in any language and using any framework.
