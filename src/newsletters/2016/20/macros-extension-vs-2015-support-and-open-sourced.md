Macros have always been popular, first as part of the product, and now as an extension. In response to <a href="https://visualstudio.uservoice.com/forums/121579-visual-studio-2015/suggestions/2650757-bring-back-macros">your feedback</a> we have upgraded the Macros for Visual Studio 2013 extension to be compatible with Visual Studio 2015. You can <a href="https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/d3fbf133-e51b-41a2-b86f-9560a96ff62b">download the upgraded extension</a> from the Visual Studio Gallery.
