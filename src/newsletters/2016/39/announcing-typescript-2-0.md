TypeScript 2.0 has been a great journey for the team, with several contributions from the community and partners along the way. It brings several new features that enhance developer productivity, advances TypeScript’s alignment with ECMAScript’s evolution, provides wide support for JavaScript libraries and tools, and augments the language service that powers a first class editing experience across tools.

To get started, you can download TypeScript 2.0 for Visual Studio 2015 (which needs Update 3), grab it with NuGet, start using TypeScript 2.0 in Visual Studio Code, or install it with npm
