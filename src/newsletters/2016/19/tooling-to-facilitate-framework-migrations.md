In <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/03/03/net-framework-compatibility-diagnostics/">this recent post</a>, Taylor introduced the <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.DotNet.FrameworkCompatibilityDiagnostics/">.NET Framework Compatibility Diagnostics</a>, a set of <a href="http://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/">Roslyn</a>-based code analyzers for detecting when an app is likely to encounter compatibility issues between two versions of the .NET Framework.Â This article gives a little behind-the-scenes look into why we chose to use Roslyn for those tools and the benefits Roslyn gives compared to just walking IL.
