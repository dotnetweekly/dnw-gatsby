In an <a href="https://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2016/05/01/logic-is-your-enemy.aspx" target="_blank">earlier column</a> I discussed how inheritance can let you use simple code to solve a complicated problem. In that column I outlined how inheritance can simplify the code required to handle two products with different pricing schemes.Â But then, like life in a Thomas Hardy novel, I pointed out that things can get worse. It turns out that your company, in addition to having two kinds of products (products and services) also has two types of customers: PremiumCustomers and TypicalCustomers. PremiumCustomers get a 10 percent discount on Products and TypicalCustomers aren't allowed to buy ServiceProducts at any price.
