Microsoft Edge Web Summit is free conference organized and staffed by the engineers building Microsoft Edge and Chakra. We'll be presenting a full day of technical talks covering the EdgeHTML rendering engine, the open-source Chakra JavaScript engine, and developer tools. You'll hear what's next for the web platform that powers Windows 10, straight from the engineers who build it, and you'll get an inside look at powerful techniques and new tools to make your life as a developer just a little bit easier.
