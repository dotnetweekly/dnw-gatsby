<a href="http://build.microsoft.com/" target="_blank">BUILD 2016</a> was two weeks ago in my favorite city, San Francisco. There was a TON of .NET content &amp; announcements delivered. Here’s a recap of all the big .NET sessions, announcements, downloads and resources. And my apologies for not getting this out sooner, but I was unexpectedly out last week. Plus, anyone trying to pay attention to all the stuff happening that week probably needed a little break anyways ;-)
