If youâ€™d like to learn how to architect solutions in Cortana Intelligence Suite and how to build intelligence into your applications, be sure to check out this event. Join Microsoft Architects Todd Kitta and Jin Cho to step through building an end-to-end solution using the Microsoft cloud data platform. Roll up your sleeves to get hands-on with the platform, and end the day with a working web app. Todd and Jin pause their instruction to give you time to work through the project with them and to ask questions.
