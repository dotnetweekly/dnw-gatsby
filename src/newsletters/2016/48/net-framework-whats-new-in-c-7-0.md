Back in December 2015, I discussed the designing of C# 7.0 (<a href="http://msdn.com/magazine/mt595758">msdn.com/magazine/mt595758</a>). A lot has changed over the last year, but the team is now buttoning down C# 7.0 development, and Visual Studio 2017 Release Candidate is implementing virtually all of the new features. (I say virtually because until Visual Studio 2017 actually ships, there’s always a chance for further change.) For a brief overview, you can check out the summary table at <a href="http://itl.tc/CSharp7FeatureSummary">itl.tc/CSharp7FeatureSummary</a>. In this article I’m going to explore each of the new features in detail.
