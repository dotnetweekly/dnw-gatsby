Much has been made of the open-source approach to developing the latest version of the .NET framework and tools.  What does that mean for me and my organization?  Can I really use these tools without some licensing gotcha?  We'll review the licensing details in terms so that mere mortals can understand them.  We'll then turn it around and show you how you can get involved with .NET by contributing to an existing project or even starting your own.  Microsoft's Maria Naggaga and Jeff Fritz will break down everything you need to know to use and contribute to the new .NET ecosystem.
