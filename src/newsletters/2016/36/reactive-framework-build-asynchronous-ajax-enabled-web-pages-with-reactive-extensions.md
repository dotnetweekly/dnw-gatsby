In an earlier article, I discussed how the observer pattern can be used to manage long-running tasks (<a href="http://msdn.com/magazine/mt707526">msdn.com/magazine/mt707526</a>). By the end of that article, I showed how Microsoft Reactive Extensions (Rx) provide a simple mechanism for managing a sequence of events from a long-running process in a Windows application. Using Rx just for monitoring a sequence of events from a long-­running task, however, doesn’t take full advantage of the technology. The beauty of Rx is that it can be used for asynchronously integrating any event-based process with any other process.
