MSTest V2 is now supported on .NET Core 1.0 RTM. API changes in .NET Core 1.0 leading up to RTM (see <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/7754">#7754</a>), were blocking users of the MSTest V2 packages we had released for .NET Core 1.0 RC2. Not any moreÂ (see <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/corefx/issues/10713">#10713</a>), we are pleased to note.
