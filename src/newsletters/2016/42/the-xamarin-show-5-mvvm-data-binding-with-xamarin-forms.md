Out of all architectural patterns Model-View-ViewModel, or MVVM, has to be my favorite. MVVM enables developers to separate their business logic from their user interface code no matter if you are developing with iOS Storyboards, Android XML, or Xamarin.Forms XAML. In this episode I cover the basic building blocks of the MVVM pattern and then introduce you to the build in data binding framework built right into Xamarin.Forms so there is no need to ever manually set a text property, register for a click handler, and automatically enable and disable controls with Commands.
