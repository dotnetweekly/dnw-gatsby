At the Build 2016 conference, Microsoft announced a first preview of Cognitive Services  (<a href="http://microsoft.com/cognitive-services">microsoft.com/cognitive-services</a>), a rich set of cross-platform, RESTful APIs that you can leverage to create the next generation of apps based on natural user interaction for any platform on any device. Cognitive Services, also known as “Project Oxford,” are based on machine learning and perfectly fit into the conversation-as-a-platform philosophy that Microsoft is willing to bring into the apps ecosystem.
