The <a href="http://dailydotnettips.com/category/visual-studio/" target="_blank">Visual Studio</a> <strong>Command Window</strong> is very powerful and can help you to execute things faster during development. The <strong>Command</strong> window can execute commands  directly in the <strong>Visual Studio</strong> by using their names. This command could be something from menu, your custom command or even hidden that are not shown in the menu. You can also use this window for debugging as well.    It’s there since beginning with Visual Studio;  however it is often overlooked and  many developers are still unaware about this great tool.
