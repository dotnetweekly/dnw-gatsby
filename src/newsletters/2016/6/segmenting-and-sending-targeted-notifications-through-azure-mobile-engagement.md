Scott talks to Piyush Joshi about how you can use Azure Mobile Engagement to target specific users and send them notifications! This is a great way to really connect to small slices of users and give them information and notifications that they care about. Notifications are also a powerful way to remind your users about your apps and keep them coming back for more!
