.NET is going through some monumental changes! It is often difficult to even begin to think about how to port our particular code to the various flavors of .NET. In this video Taylor Southwick and Connie Yau spend some time discussing a great tool that will definitely help in this difficult process. I was impressed with how easy it was to ascertain trouble spots that might cause issues when attempting to port libraries over to a more lightweight portable profile. Would love your comments!
