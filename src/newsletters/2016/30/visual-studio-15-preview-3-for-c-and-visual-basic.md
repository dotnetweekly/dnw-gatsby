One of our major focuses in Visual Studio ‘15′ is improving developer productivity inside the editor. As we develop, we all perform series of actions over and over again–like writing methods, renaming variables, changing method signatures, implementing interfaces, etc. Our goal is to help automate or reduce these tasks to a single click so that you can focus on logic rather than syntax, references, style, and formatting. You may have noticed each Visual Studio ‘15’ release enhances existing experiences to save you a little more time and effort and enables you to build faster with additional refactorings and code generation.
