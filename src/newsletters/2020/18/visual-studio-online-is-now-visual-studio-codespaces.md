Microsoftâ€™s web-based development environment, Visual Studio Online, has been rebranded to Visual Studio Codespaces. This is a web-based development environment (IDE) based on the popular Visual Studio Code IDE. It offers a familiar feel and workspace for writing and working with source code. It also supports extensibility by supporting extensions to the editor.
