Svelte is a Javascript framework, a compiler and a language. Unlike other Frameworks such as React and Vue which do much of their work in the browser, Svelte does its work in the compile step, which results in highly efficient code and a potentially faster run-time on the client-side.

  In this course, Noah Kaufman will teach you Svelte by building a fun chatbot. The course contains several interactive coding challenges, where you'll be encouraged to write your first lines of Svelte code. This will solidify your learning, so we strongly encourage you to do these challenges along the way.
