We’re pleased to introduce the first preview of Source Generators, a new C# compiler feature that lets C# developers inspect user code and generate new C# source files that can be added to a compilation. This is done via a new kind of component that we’re calling a Source Generator.

To get started with Source Generators, you’ll need to install the latest .NET 5 preview and the latest Visual Studio preview.
