The extent of this post is generally targeting the whole ORM families running in various technology stacks. But I will limit the explanation to only .NET (C# or VB) and will write the samples in C#.

I am the author of RepoDb and most samples could be specifics to this ORM, but again, the rationale of this post is beyond the technology stacks and libraries you preferred to work with. Think of all the samples as a code for your favorite ORM (ie: Entity Framework, NHibernate, LLBLGen or Dapper).
