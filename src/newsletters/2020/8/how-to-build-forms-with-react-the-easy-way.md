Earlier this week we discussed how to build fully-featured React forms with KendoReact, which is another great React forms tutorial. In this article, we’ll take a step back and discuss the challenges inherent to building forms with just React, such as state management and validation, and then how to solve them with the KendoReact Form component.

Forms are hard, regardless of the framework or libraries you use to create them. But with React forms are especially tricky, as the official React form documentation is brief and doesn’t discuss topics that real-world forms always need, such as form validation.

In this article, you’ll learn how to build React forms the easy way using the newly released KendoReact Form component. You’ll learn how to simplify your form’s state management, how to integrate with custom components like date pickers and drop-down lists, and how to implement robust form validation.

Let’s get started.
