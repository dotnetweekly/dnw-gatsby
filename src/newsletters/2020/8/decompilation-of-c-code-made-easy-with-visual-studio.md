Have you ever found yourself debugging a .NET project or memory dump only to be confronted with a No Symbols Loaded page? Or maybe experienced an exception occurring in a 3rd party .NET assembly but had no source code to figure out why? You can now use Visual Studio to decompile managed code even if you donâ€™t have the symbols, allowing you to look at code, inspect variables and set breakpoints.

We have recently released a new decompilation and symbol creation experience in the latest preview of Visual Studio 2019 version 16.5 that will aid debugging in situations where you might be missing symbol files or source code. As we launch this feature, we want to ensure that we are creating the most intuitive workflows so please provide feedback.
