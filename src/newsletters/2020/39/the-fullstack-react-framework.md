“Zero-API” data layer lets you import server code directly into your React components instead of having to manually add API endpoints and do client-side fetching and caching.

Includes everything you need for production apps. Everything end-to-end from the database to the frontend.

Blitz brings back the simplicity and conventions of server-rendered frameworks like Ruby on Rails while preserving everything we love about React and client-side rendering!
