Itâ€™s a Roslyn analyzers library meant for checking our usage of both data collections coming from System.Collections and LINQ APIs. This tool is here to help developers make more informed performance decisions through a set of micro-optimizations. This project started as an internal hackathon project and we're now releasing it to the public.
