Azure Static Web Apps is a service that automatically builds and deploys full stack web apps from a GitHub repository. Azure Static Web Apps consist of a static web frontend, and an Azure Functions based backend. When you create a Static Web Apps resource, Azure sets up a GitHub Actions workflow in the appâ€™s source code repository that monitors a branch of your choice. Every time you push commits to the watched branch, the GitHub Action automatically builds and deploys your app and its API.
