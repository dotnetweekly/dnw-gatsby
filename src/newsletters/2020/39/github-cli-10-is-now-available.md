GitHub CLI brings GitHub to your terminal. It reduces context switching, helps you focus, and enables you to more easily script and create your own workflows. Earlier this year, we announced the beta of GitHub CLI. Since we released the beta, users have created over 250,000 pull requests, performed over 350,000 merges, and created over 20,000 issues with GitHub CLI. Weâ€™ve received so much thoughtful feedback, and today GitHub CLI is out of beta and available to download on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

With GitHub CLI 1.0, you can:

Run your entire GitHub workflow from the terminal, from issues through releases
Call the GitHub API to script nearly any action, and set a custom alias for any command
Connect to GitHub Enterprise Server in addition to GitHub.com
