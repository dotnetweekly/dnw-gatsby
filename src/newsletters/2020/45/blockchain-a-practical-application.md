This article is a practical application of Wei-Meng Lee's May/June 2018 article: Understanding Blockchain: A Beginners Guide to Ethereum Smart Contract Programming (https://bit.ly/3i2fu2C). Of all the most talked about and hyped topics in technology today, blockchain is at the top of the list. Almost without exception, the terms blockchain and crypto currency are used interchangeably for the basic reason that crypto currencies are based on blockchain. But not all blockchains are crypto currencies. It follows that we can discuss and implement blockchain independently of crypto currencies and the peer-to-peer networks within which the blockchains that are central to crypto currencies reside.
