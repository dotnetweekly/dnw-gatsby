Back in 2017, there was a party celebrating the 15th anniversary of .NET shipping. I had the opportunity to do some short interviews with folks at the party that were part of .NET way back at the beginning. You can see some of those interviews on Channel 9 at Happy Birthday .NET! After the evening was over, it occured to me that we needed to write these stories down before they get lost. That was the beginning of what has evolved into a multi-year effort to collect the tales that led to the creation and evolution of .NET. The book has been coming for awhile now, sign up here to be kept up-to-date on its development and the many stories behind creating it!
