My goal was to find the fastest low-level CSV parser. Essentially, all I wanted was a library that gave me a string[] for each line where each field in the line was an element in the array. This is about as simple as you can get with a CSV parser. I donâ€™t care about parsing headings or dynamically mapping fields to class properties. I can do all of that myself faster than reflection with C# Source Generators, rather trivially.
