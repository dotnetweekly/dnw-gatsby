In this post, Iâ€™m going to introduce you to a GitHub Action that creates machine-translations for .NET localization. GitHub Actions allow you to build, test, and deploy your code right from GitHub, but they also allow for other workflows. You can perform nearly any action imaginable against your source code as it evolves. With the Machine Translator GitHub Action, you configure a workflow to automatically create pull requests as translation source file change.
