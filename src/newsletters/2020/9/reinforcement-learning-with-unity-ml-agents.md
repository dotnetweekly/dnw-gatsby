A couple of years ago Unity started working on a framework, that would enable training machine learning algorithms in virtual environments: ML-Agents Toolkit. It is used by a number of companies across the world, including famous DeepMind, to aid research in computer vision and robotics in such tasks as autonomous driving.

In this post we present an example bot built with C# and TensorFlow framework, that learns to play a game in a simple Unity-based virtual environment using one of the state of the art reinforcement learning algorithms: soft actor-critic.
