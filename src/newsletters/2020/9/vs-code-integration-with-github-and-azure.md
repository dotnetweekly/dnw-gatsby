In this episode, Robert is joined by Aaron Powell, who demonstrates Visual Studio Code and its integrations with GitHub and Azure. Aaron shows that VS Code provides a complete developer experience that enables you to spend more time and effort on coding and less time switching between tools. Visual Studio developers are used to this. Now, Visual Studio Code developers have this experience as well.
