This post might seem bizzare at first. In fact the idea of writing this article did not come to me on my own. The original idea came from a James Newton King tweet, this last is offering a way to write an API in the simplest possible way, efficient and without any particular framework. I found it cool and that’s why I’m making it a post today. Here is his original tweet: https://twitter.com/JamesNK/status/1276450146365001728
