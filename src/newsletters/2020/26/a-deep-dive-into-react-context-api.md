It always begins with a single component. You could maybe define a class or functional component, but ultimately you must always be ready to render. You can have data in the form of local state(s), or functionality in form of, say, event handlers.

Your component will grow in responsibility and complexity. No component is a singleton, you learned, so you break your component down.
