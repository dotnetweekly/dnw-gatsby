gRPC-Web for .NET is now officially released. We announced experimental support in January and since then weâ€™ve been making improvements based on feedback from early adopters.

With this release gRPC-Web graduates to a fully supported component of the grpc-dotnet project and is ready for production. Use gRPC in the browser with gRPC-Web and .NET today.
