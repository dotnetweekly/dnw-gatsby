Since the early days of C# 9, I’ve been doing writeups on all of the new features including init-only properties, record types, top level programs and more. And ever since those writeups, I’ve had people say “Yeah, I get I can read that, but can you just give me the gist of how to use the feature?”. I thought that a single page writeup would be short enough but I do get that it’s sometimes easier to explain in a 1 minute video. And so that’s what I’ve done!
