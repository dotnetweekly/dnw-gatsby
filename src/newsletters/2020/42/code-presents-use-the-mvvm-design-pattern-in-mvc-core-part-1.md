This 3-part article series presents how to use the Model-View-View-Model (MVVM) design pattern in MVC Core applications. The MVVM approach has long been used in WPF applications but hasn't been as prevalent in MVC or MVC Core applications. This article illustrates how using MVVM in MVC makes your applications even more reusable, testable, and maintainable. You're going to be guided step-by-step building an MVC Core application using the Entity Framework (EF) and a view model class to display and search for product data.
