Azure Cache for Redis is an in-memory data store that is used to power fast, scalable applications. Now in preview, you can access all the caches under your Azure subscriptions and view their data with the new Azure Cache for Redis Visual Studio Code extension.

With this new integration, you’ll be able to use Visual Studio Code to view, test, and debug your caches—in one streamlined experience. This extension enhances ease of development by eliminating the need to manually track connection and access keys to connect to your caches. Simply authenticate with your Azure account, and you’ll instantly be able to access your Azure Cache for Redis instances.
