The IEEE 754 specification defines many floating point types, including: binary16, binary32, binary64 and binary128. Most developers are familiar with binary32 (equivalent to float in C#) and binary64 (equivalent to double in C#). They provide a standard format to represent a wide range of values with a precision acceptable for many applications. .NET has always had float and double and with .NET 5 Preview 7, weâ€™ve added a new Half type (equivalent to binary16)!
