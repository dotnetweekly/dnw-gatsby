For the longest time, if you wanted to sync settings across Visual Studio Code instances, you’d need to use Shan Khan’s extension Settings Sync. That was essentially your only option. In fact, that extension has had nearly 2 million installs to date! There’s still a great benefit to using the extension. For one, you could backup the settings to GitHub and compare versions of the settings. However, if you’re looking for a native implementation, the Visual Studio Code team now has one.
