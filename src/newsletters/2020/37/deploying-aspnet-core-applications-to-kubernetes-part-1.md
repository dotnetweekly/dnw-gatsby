This post is the first in a series on deploying ASP.NET Core applications to Kubernetes. In this series I'll cover a variety of topics and things I've learned in deploying applications to Kubernetes. I'm not an expert on Kubernetes by any means, so I'm not going to go deep into a lot of the technical aspects, or describe setting up a Kubernetes cluster. Instead I'm going to focus on the app-developer's side, taking an application and deploying it to an existing cluster.
