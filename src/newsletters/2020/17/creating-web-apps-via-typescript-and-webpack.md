This blog post describes how to create web apps via TypeScript and webpack. We will only be using the DOM API, not a particular frontend framework. The repository ts-demo-webpack with the files can be downloaded from GitHub.

Required knowledge: It helps if you have a rough understanding of how TypeScript, webpack, and npm work.
