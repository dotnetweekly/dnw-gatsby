ASP.NET Core Hero .NET 5 Clean Architecture Boilerplate is here! #released. Clean Architecture Solution Template for ASP.NET Core 5.0. Built with Onion/Hexagonal Architecture and incorporates the most essential Packages your projects will ever need. Includes both WebApi and Web(MVC) Projects. An idea to bring together the best and essential practices/packages of ASP.NET Core 5.0 along with Clean Hexagonal Architecture that can be a right fit for small/mid and enterprise-level solutions. How easy would it be if you are able to run a single line of CLI command on your Console and you get a complete implementation in no time? That's the exact vision I have while building this full-fledged Boilerplate template.
