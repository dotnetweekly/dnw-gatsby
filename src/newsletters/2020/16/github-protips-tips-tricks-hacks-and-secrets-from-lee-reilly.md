I’ve been using GitHub as an engineering, business development, and marketing manager for over 10 years now—quite the career trajectory! Along the way, I’ve picked up a few tricks to manage my notifications, quickly locate content and create pull requests, push markdown to its limits, and personalize my experience with some third party extensions. I’m sharing a few of my favorites, and hopefully there’s something new and helpful for you.
