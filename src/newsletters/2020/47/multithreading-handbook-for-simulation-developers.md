Multithreading can be hard to get right. But it’s also vitally important to getting simulations running smoothly on resource constrained mobile devices. In my career at Microsoft I’ve had the opportunity to spend more than 4 years helping partners write high performance apps for HoloLens. I also spent another 4 years helping partners write high performance apps for phones and tablets.
