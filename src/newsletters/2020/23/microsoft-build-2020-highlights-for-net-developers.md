Over the course of the last three days, Microsoft Build 2020 released a flood of news and announcements. For those of us who follow the .NET ecosystem, it can be difficult to wade through them all!

I’ve collected a list of announcements that I think are interesting as a .NET developer, and added short summaries. The announcements are grouped into four categories: ASP.NET, .NET, Visual Studio and Windows.

In addition, each category is split into "released" (you can use it now!) or "preview / announced" (you can test it out now, or soon).
