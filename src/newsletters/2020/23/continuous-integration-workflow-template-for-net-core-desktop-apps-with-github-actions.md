We know how time consuming it can be to quickly set up continuous integration and continuous deployment workflows (CI/CD) for your WPF and Windows Forms desktop applications.

Thatâ€™s why, in cooperation with the GitHub Actions team, we have released a starter workflow in GitHub to help you quickly set up and showcase DevOps for your applications using the recently released GitHub Actions.

With GitHub Actions, you can quickly and easily automate your software workflows with CI/CD.

Integrate code changes directly into GitHub to speed up development cycles
Trigger builds to quickly identify build breaks and create testable debug builds
Continuously run tests to identify and eliminate bugs
Automatically sign, package and deploy branches that pass tests
