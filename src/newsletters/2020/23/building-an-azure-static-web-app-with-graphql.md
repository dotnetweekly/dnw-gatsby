At Microsoft Build we launched the preview of a new product, Azure Static Web Apps. This is a product I've been wanting for years on Azure as I've done a lot of static websites on Azure (see Cutting Azure Costs for DDD Sydney) but they were always been a bit clunky, especially when it comes to integration with a backend. I have it working for some apps, but there's a lot of infrastructure overhead.

But now, with Static Web Apps, it's a whole lot easier as it's designed for this by using a combination of static hosting and Azure Functions. We've got some fantastic docs (I wrote the Hugo, Gatsby and VuePress docs ðŸ˜‰) that will get you up and running on all things Static Web Apps.
