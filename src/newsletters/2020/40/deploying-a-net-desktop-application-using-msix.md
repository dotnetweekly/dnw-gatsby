MSIX is a Windows app package format that provides a modern packaging experience to all Windows apps. The MSIX package format preserves the functionality of existing app packages and/or install files in addition to enabling new, modern packaging and deployment features to Win32, WPF, and Windows Forms apps. MSIX provides useful features such as auto-updates, file associations, clean uninstall, managability (GPO / PowerShell), etc.
