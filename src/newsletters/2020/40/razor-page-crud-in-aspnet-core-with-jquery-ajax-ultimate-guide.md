Let's Build an ASP. NET Core Razor Page Web Application with CRUD Operations. This is not any simple CRUD Tutorial but coupled with quite a lot of other features too. Here is what you will be learning.

Setting up a Solution following Clean / Onion Architecture
Entity Framework Core
Repository Pattern with Unit Of Work
Razor Pages
Bootstrap Modal
JQuery AJAX Calls to render the Razor Partial Views with no Page Reloads whatsoever.
jQuery Datatables
Client Side Validation with jQuery Unobstructive Library
and so much more.

Basically what we will build is a CRUD Application with Rich User Experience and Blazing Fast Operations. Thanks to jQuery!
