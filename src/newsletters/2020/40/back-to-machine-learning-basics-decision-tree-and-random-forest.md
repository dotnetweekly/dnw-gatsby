In a previous couple of articles, we explored some basic machine learning algorithms. Thus far we covered some simple regression algorithms, classification algorithms and we started with algorithms that can be used for both types of problems. We used technologies like TensorFlow, Pytorch and SciKit Learn for the implementation and application of these algorithms. Apart from that we used optimization techniques such as Gradient Descent. So far we have covered:

Linear Regression
Simple Classification Algorithms
Support Vector Machine
