You’re sending an HTTP request to your ASP.NET server, and out of the blue, it returns a 500 error. Now what? The error code doesn’t say too much by itself. Did a database request fail?

Wouldn’t it be great if you could see the failure as if you’re breaking on an exception while debugging in Visual Studio?
