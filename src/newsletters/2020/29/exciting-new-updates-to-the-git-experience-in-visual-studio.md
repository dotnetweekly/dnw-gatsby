We’ve seen a lot of enthusiasm in the past few months with the improvements we’ve been making to the Git integration for Visual Studio 2019. We’ve also received a healthy amount of good feedback that’s helped us focus our efforts. We first announced the new changes in a blog post in March. Since then, the team has been hard at work analyzing the feedback, polishing the user interface, and building more features. We’re excited to share those updates with you today.

If you haven’t tried the new Git user experience in Visual Studio yet, download the latest Preview and you’ll get the newest updates to the experience by default. If you’re using the public Release of Visual Studio (version 16.6+), then hit Ctrl+Q to search and type in ‘New Git user experience’ to turn it on from the Preview Features pane of Tools – Options.
