.NET for Apache Spark provides high performance APIs for using Apache Spark from C# and F#. With these .NET APIs, you can access the most popular Dataframe and SparkSQL aspects of Apache Spark, for working with structured data, and Spark Structured Streaming, for working with streaming data.

.NET for Apache Spark is compliant with .NET Standard - a formal specification of .NET APIs that are common across .NET implementations. This means you can use .NET for Apache Spark anywhere you write .NET code allowing you to reuse all the knowledge, skills, code, and libraries you already have as a .NET developer.

.NET for Apache Spark runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS using .NET Core, or Windows using .NET Framework. It also runs on all major cloud providers including Azure HDInsight Spark, Amazon EMR Spark, AWS & Azure Databricks.

Note: We currently have a Spark Project Improvement Proposal JIRA at SPIP: .NET bindings for Apache Spark to work with the community towards getting .NET support by default into Apache Spark. We highly encourage you to participate in the discussion.
