You can clone the dashboard in Azure Portal. The cloning dashboard helps quickly extend any existing dashboard, that either you can share and use for your monitoring purpose. You can create your dashboards such as Azure service health dashboard or any other Azure services monitoring or data flow dashboard, and it could be useful sharing the dashboard with others in case they need the same. Some cases may require additional charges, or you may want to take out some of the details.
