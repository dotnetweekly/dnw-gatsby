This year, at Build, we have an incredible 31 sessions covering Power Platform and Azure. This volume of sessions at a professional developer conference is a turning point for the Power Platform, so I wanted to take a moment and reflect on this growing fusion of low-code and code-first development.

Over the next three years, more than 500 million digital apps and services will be developed and deployed*. Traditional code-first development will be unable to scale to support this growing demand on its own. Instead, code-first tools will need to be combined with low-code development tools like Power Apps.
