Eight years ago, universities like MIT and Stanford first opened up free online courses to the public. Today, close to 1000 schools around the world have created thousands of free online courses, popularly known as Massive Open Online Courses or MOOCs.

I’ve compiled this list of 620+ such free online courses that you can start this month. For this, I leveraged Class Central’s database of over 15,000 online courses. I’ve also included each course’s average rating.
