Today we start building an old school style RPG game using JavaScript, React, Custom React Hooks, Event Listeners, Sprites, and more! This first screencast will cover sprite walk animations and moving around the screen as well as adding basic zone info and tilesets.

Next week I will be releasing the second part which is about creating maps and zones. Following that will be the fight screens. I think this series will be 6-9 parts and I will be releasing them 3 in a row, 1 a week!
