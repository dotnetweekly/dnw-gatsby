In this stream, we take on a fun little experiment. We embed an HTML/JavaScrip rich text editor, named “Quill JS”, into a native WPF application. We utilize the WebView web browser control, C#, a little bit of JavaScript interop, and a whole lot of JavaScript to achieve our goals. We even try to mimic the Microsoft Teams chat editor experience. This was really fun and I need to do more experiments like this.
