Like Redux, Recoil is a state management library in React. Let’s look at the differences and how to make the switch when you’re ready.

Managing complex state in React can sometimes be hard, which is why some of us use Redux or similar libraries like MobX to manage state in React.

Recoil is another state management library that is closely modeled towards React’s Hooks API. It allows you to define the shared state as atoms, and computed state which it refers to as selectors.
