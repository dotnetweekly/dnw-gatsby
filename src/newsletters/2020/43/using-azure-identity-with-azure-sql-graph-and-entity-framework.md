My name is Mickaël Derriey and I work at Telstra Purple, the largest IT consultancy in Australia. I’m part of an internal team where my main focus is to support .NET applications we developed in-house, most of which are hosted in Azure and integrate with a variety of workloads like Azure SQL, Blob Storage, or the Microsoft Graph API.
