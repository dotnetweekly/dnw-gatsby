Project Jupyter is a non-profit, open-source project, born out of the IPython Project in 2014 as it evolved to support interactive data science and scientific computing across all programming languages. Jupyter will always be 100% open-source software, free for all to use and released under the liberal terms of the modified BSD license.

Jupyter is developed in the open on GitHub, through the consensus of the Jupyter community. For more information on our governance approach, please see our Governance Document.
