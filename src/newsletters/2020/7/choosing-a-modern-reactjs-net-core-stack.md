One of our Calavista development teams and I are having a kind of kickoff meeting tomorrow morning to discuss our new technical stack that we plan to use for some big new customer-facing features in a large web application this year. The current application we’re building onto was originally designed about a decade ago and uses a lot of the .Net tools and approaches that I myself would have espoused at that time and even a few OSS things that I helped build — but some of which are clearly aluminum wiring today (RIP K. Scott Allen) or at least have been surpassed by later tools.
