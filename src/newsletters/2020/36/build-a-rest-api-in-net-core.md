One way to scale large complex solutions is to break them out into REST microservices. Microservices unlock testability and reusability of business logic that sits behind an API boundary. This allows organizations to share software modules because REST APIs can be reused by multiple clients. Clients can then call as many APIs from mobile, web, or even static assets via a single-page app.
