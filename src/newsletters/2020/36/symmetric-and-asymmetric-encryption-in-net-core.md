This post looks at symmetric and asymmetric encryption and how this could be implemented in .NET Core. Symmetric encryption is fast and can encrypt or decrypt large amounts of text, streams or files but requires a shared key. Asymmetric encryption can be used without shared a key, but can only encrypt or decrypt small texts depending of the key size.
