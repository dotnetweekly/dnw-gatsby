We recently released the 1.0 version of our Visual Studio Code Docker extension, which is the first general availability (GA) release. The Docker extension makes it easier to build apps that leverage Docker containers. The extension helps scaffold needed files, build Docker images, debug your app inside a container, and an explorer that makes it easy to take actions on containers and images such as start, stop, inspect, remove, and more.
