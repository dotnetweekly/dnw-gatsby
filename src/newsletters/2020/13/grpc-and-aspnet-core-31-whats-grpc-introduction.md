gRPC is an RPC (Remote procedure call) framework and not a Microsoft framework. It runs on HTTP/2 and it uses Protocol Buffers serialization format. gRPC provides bi-directional data transport and allows flow control (cancellation and waiting times). gRPC has been created by Google around 2003/2004 and they open sourced it in 2015. Many languages had implemented it except .NET, Finally Microsoft released a .NET version with ASP.NET Core 3.0 in September 2019.
