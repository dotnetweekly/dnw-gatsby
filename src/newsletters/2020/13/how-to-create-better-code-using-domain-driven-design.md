In this post, I am going to present how you can use domain-driven design tactical patterns like value object, entity, repository, domain event, factory, and domain service, to write better code. By better code I mean code that is more readable, easier to reason about and maintain. We will start with business requirements, then we will have a look at implementation that does not use domain driven design and has an anemic model, then we will analyze problems related to such approach and compare it with code build with help of domain-driven design tactical patterns.
