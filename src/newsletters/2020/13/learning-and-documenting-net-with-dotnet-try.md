Learning a new programming language is always hard. You have to read the documentation, stop, go to the IDE of your choice, start a new project, compile and run the program and see the results. Stop. Restart. After some time, you have no more patience for the process and start to skip some steps (maybe I don’t need to run this sample here…) until the point that you try to find an easier way, but most of the time there is no easier way.

Well, now there is an easier way. The dotnet team has created a new tool, called dotnet try that allows you to have documentation mixed with a code sample window, where you can try the code while reading the documentation. Cool, no?
