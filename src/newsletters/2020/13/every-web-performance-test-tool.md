Here is every Web Performance Test Tool I know of to help identify issues in your site/get you some key speed metrics. The idea is you think of a feature you want, e.g. "TTFB" or "locations" or "waterfall" and just Cmd + F on this page to find a tool that helps you with that thing.

Please let me know if you have other tools that belong here
