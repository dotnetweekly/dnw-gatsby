One of the quickest ways to earn the ire of a DBA is to shrug your shoulders, and tell them you don't know what code created the query that is slowing down their server. Sure, with a little hunting and knowledge of the code base you can generally spot the offending query, but wouldn't it be nice if the query the DBA is looking at had more information to track it down?
