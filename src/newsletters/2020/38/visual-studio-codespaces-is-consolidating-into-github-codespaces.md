At the last Ignite, we announced the public preview of Visual Studio Codespaces and shared our vision for cloud-powered development environments that would enable developers to work from anywhere and on any platform. Since then, we’ve seen incredible validation and excitement about codespaces and the scenarios they enable. We’ve also shipped dozens of enhancements, adjusted to better align with your expectations, and amassed feedback to help inform our roadmap. A key piece of this roadmap was partnering with our friends at GitHub to provide a native experience using the same service that powers Visual Studio Codespaces. Today, we’d like to share some news regarding this partnership: Visual Studio Codespaces will be consolidating into GitHub Codespaces.
