Today, we are shipping .NET 5.0 Release Candidate 1 (RC1). It is a near-final release of .NET 5.0, and the first of two RCs before the official release in November. RC1 is a “go live” release; you are supported using it in production. At this point, we’re looking for reports of any remaining critical bugs that should be fixed before the final release. We need your feedback to get .NET 5.0 across the finish line.
