I’ve been using Azure Cosmos DB on a fairly regular basis for the last 2 years or so. It’s a pretty good database, but one thing has always bothered me: the lack of a proper tool to query and modify data in the database. Basically, here are the current options:

The standalone Cosmos DB Explorer website
The Data Explorer in the Azure Portal
Cosmos DB support in Azure Storage Explorer
