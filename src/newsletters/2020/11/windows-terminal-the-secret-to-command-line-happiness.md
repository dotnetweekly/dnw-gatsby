Learn all about Windows Terminal and how it can improve your development workflow.

If you're a developer (or IT professional) who likes to use the command line and appreciates an organized, customized, fast workflow... this episode is for you! 

Run PowerShell, Ubuntu (Linux), Azure CLI, Oh-my-Zsh, and Posh-Git command lines all in one terminal via multiple tabs.
Open each command line in separate split panes, all in the same terminal window using shortcut keys to jump between them.
Customize your font, background colors or images, shortcut keys, and default profiles.
Checkout some demos and see what's good.
