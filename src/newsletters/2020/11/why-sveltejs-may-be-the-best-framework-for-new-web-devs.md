Any web dev who's been at it for a few years has likely heard this question every other day.

I'm really interested in learning about web development, but I don't know how to start. Any suggestions?

A decade ago, this would have been an easy answer. Just make an index.html, throw some tags in there, make that header turn red with CSS, and reach for JQuery (or plane ole JavaScript, depending on who you ask) to handle those mouse clicks!
