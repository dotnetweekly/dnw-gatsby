In my last post (Get Started with Blazor), we discussed the Blazor Framework, Hosting models and how to set up authentication and authorization in a Blazor server-side application with an example.  In this post, I am going to explain CRUD using Blazor and Entity Framework Core.  I will use the sample application we have created in the previous post and extend it with the new functionalities we are going to talk about in this post.  You will be familiar with the following topics after you read this post.

Entity Framework Core â€“ Setup in Blazor application
Using Bootstrap Modals
Child Components
Validation
JavaScript Interop
Communication Between Components
Templated Components using Render Fragments (Dynamic Content)
