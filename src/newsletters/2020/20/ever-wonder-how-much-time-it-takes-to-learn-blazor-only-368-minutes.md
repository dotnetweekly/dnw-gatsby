This application is a very simple ASP.NET Core application, which crawls and outputs a generated Razor Page, which shows how much time is needed to read through the full ASP.NET Core Docs. I was interested primarily how much time it would take to learn Blazor A-Z, so I decided to calculate it programatically. It was just one more step to calculate it for the entire documentation site. As it turns out, if you concentrate on reading through the docs, <b>you can learn Blazor in about 368 minutes</b>, so less than a full workday! The entire documentation page takes 5691 minutes, which means you can be adept in all thing ASP.NET Core in 3 days, 22 hours and 51 minutes!
