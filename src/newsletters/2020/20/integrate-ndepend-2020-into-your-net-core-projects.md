In computer science and software engineering in particular, software quality is an overall assessment of software, based on numerous indicators.
Comprehensiveness of functionality, correctness and accuracy of results, reliability, fault tolerance, ease and flexibility of use, simplicity, extensibility, compatibility and portability, ease of correction and transformation, performance, consistency and integrity of the information it contains are all quality factors.
In software engineering, factoring data and code is the universal way to get quality.
We will talk in this article about NDepend, a tool to help software developers achieve a high level of quality in their programs.
