As a part of our PowerShell 7 release, the PowerShell Team put together a series of videos explaining and demoing aspects of the release. The intent of these videos was for User Groups to host events celebrating and discussing PowerShell 7, however, in light of the current guidance against group gatherings, we have decided to make these videos available publicly on the PowerShell Team YouTube channel.
