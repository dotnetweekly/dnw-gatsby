This year’s .NET Conf was the largest one yet, with over 80 live sessions across three days that were co-organized and presented by the .NET community and Microsoft. On top of all of that, it also marked the release of .NET 5.0 that brings a full set of new capabilities, performance gains, and new languages features for developers to create amazing apps. If you missed this year’s .NET Conf live stream, don’t worry because we have you covered!
