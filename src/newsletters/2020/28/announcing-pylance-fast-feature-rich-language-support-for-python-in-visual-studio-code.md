We are excited to announce Pylance, our fast and feature-rich language support for Python! Pylance is available today in the Visual Studio Code marketplace.

Pylance depends on our core Python extension and builds upon that experience, for those of you who have already installed it.

Optimized performance
Pylance is a new language server for Python, which uses the Language Server Protocol to communicate with VS Code.

The name Pylance serves as a nod to Monty Python’s Lancelot, who is the first knight to answer the bridgekeeper’s questions in the Holy Grail.
