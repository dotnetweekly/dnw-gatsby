When building micro-services it is very important to take into consideration which messaging mechanism you use. There are several ways in which micro-services communicate using different messaging protocols. Today we will focus on the AMQP messaging protocol with rabbitmq and asp.net core.

What is Rabbitmq ?
Rabbitmq is a messaging system that permits your applications communicate together using messages and queues. Rabbitmq uses the AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol) messaging protocol. It is opensource and is very robust. Rabbitmq is written in Erlang, a functional programming language created for telecommunication systems by Ericsson. Erlang is a concurrent programming language with several other features which permit it to be an ideal choice for building highly robust and resilient messaging systems.
