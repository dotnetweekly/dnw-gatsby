In a previous blog post, I wrote about how mental models help you understand how something works. These models in your mind explain what did happen in the past and provide a reasonable (but not always reliable) prediction for will happen in the future. Interestingly, mental models can do that even though they are simplified, incomplete, and often enough simply wrong.
