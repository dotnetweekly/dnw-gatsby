The project in its completed state is a real-time game that uses ASP.NET Core frameworks Blazor WebAssembly, Web API, Identity, SignalR and Entity Framework Core. All used software are free to use, and all code written is based on open source software mainly made available by Microsoft.

The goal of this project to get an "in-depth, deep-dive overview" of the above frameworks, primarily intended for people who are at least a little familiar with the .NET ecosystem. Unless high demand requires it, not much explanation will be added to the steps required, as the primary documentation by Microsoft is the best place to learn these technologies. This project focuses on dipping your toes into each of these technologies, focusing on the latest and greatest of them all, Blazor. At the time of writing, Blazor WebAssembly is in public preview for ASP.NET Core 3.1 (version 3.2.0-rc1.20223.4) with the production ready version coming in the following weeks. The project can be completed at a steady pace in about 90-120 minutes. Obviously, the project is not a production ready application, has bugs, anomalies and is rough around the edges, but feel free to view the current issues, open a new issue, fork or send me a pull request if you so desire, as any community interaction is most welcome.

We are going to create a game that is similar to Microsoft Minesweeper, but instead of marking and avoiding spots which contain mines, you collect treasure in their place in a multiplayer, turn-based setting.
