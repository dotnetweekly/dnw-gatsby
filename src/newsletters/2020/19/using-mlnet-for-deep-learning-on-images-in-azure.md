In March 2020, ML.NET added support for training Image Classification models in Azure. Although the image classification scenario was released in late 2019, users were limited by the resources on their local compute environments. Training in Azure enables users to scale image classification scenarios by using GPU optimized Linux virtual machines.

This post will show how to train a custom image classification model in Azure to categorize flowers using ML.NET Model Builder. Then, you can leverage your existing .NET skills to consume the trained model inside a C# .NET Core console application. Best of all, little to no prior machine learning knowledge is required. Letâ€™s get started!
