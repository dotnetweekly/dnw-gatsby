One exciting feature of the upcoming .NET 5 are Source Generators.

Source Generators as the name suggests generate C# source code as part of the compilation process. Code generation is not a new concept in Visual Studio and .NET â€“ for example T4 templates have been around for a while now and enable you to programmatically generate/transform content that can be compiled. There are also techniques such as IL Weaving that tools such as Fody use to manipulate the assembly that is produced from the compilation process.
