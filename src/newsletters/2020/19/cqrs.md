CQRS is a simple pattern that strictly segregates the responsibility of handling command input into an autonomous system from the responsibility of handling side-effect-free query/read access on the same system.

If you are familiar with Domain-Driven Design, you’ve most likely heard about, Command-Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS). Though the CQRS pattern is well-known, there are still a lot of misconceptions around this pattern, especially when it comes to applying it in real-world software projects.

In this article, you will learn exactly what CQRS is, the principles behind it, and the benefits it can provide for your project.

We will see a detailed, step-by-step process of implementing this pattern in practice using a sample project we’ll be working on. This project will be close to what you can see in the real world, and I will explain each step on the way to implement CQRS in great detail.
