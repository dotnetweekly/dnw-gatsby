Officially announced at the "Focus on Blazor" .NET Conf, Blazor's Mobile Bindings are a new experimental project aimed to enable cross-platform mobile app development using Microsoft Blazor and .NET for iOS and Android. Similarly to React Native, Mobile Blazor Binding use native UI controls, thus enabling a native look and feel.

In a nutshell, Mobile Blazor Bindings extend the Blazor programming model for mobile development. As Microsoft .NET engineer Eilon Lipton wrote, this will be of specific interest to XAML and Xamarin developers who have been using XAML, Razor templates, and Xamarin to build mobile hybrid apps or to those using Blazor to create Web apps.
