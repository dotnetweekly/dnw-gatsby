One of the technologies that has come around through the DevOps movement of increased communication and cooperation between the Development and Operations teams has been Infrastructure as Code (IaC). These are technologies that DevOps Engineers and Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) have been adopting to build the latest technique of infrastructure automation in the cloud. Microsoft Azure natively supports ARM Templates for implementing IaC, but thatâ€™s an Azure specific technology.

With the help of HashiCorp Terraform, we now have an open source, Infrastructure as Code tool that is cloud agnostic, providing an infrastructure automation tool that works with any cloud provider, including Microsoft Azure, and can simultaneously work across multiple cloud providers in a single infrastructure deployment.
