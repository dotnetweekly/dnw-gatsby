Hey Python community! It’s been a while since we’ve last posted about this, but we’re excited to present new capabilities we’ve added to the VS Code Azure Machine Learning (AML) extension. From version 0.6.12 onwards we’ve introduced UI changes and ways to help you manage Datastores, Datasets, and Compute instances all from directly within your favourite editor!

We’re guessing many of you may be reading about Azure ML and the extension for the first time – don’t worry, we’re here to explain!

Azure ML is a machine learning service that provides a wide set of tools and resources for data scientists to build, train, and deploy models. The AML extension is a companion tool to the service which provides a guided experience to help create and manage resources from directly within VS Code. The extension aims to streamline tasks such as running experiments, creating compute targets, and managing environments, without requiring the context-switch from the editor to the browser. Extensions users are enabled to work across their workspaces and interact with their core AML assets via an easy-to-navigate tree view and single-click commands.
