Along with launching new content in August, we're also hosting a LIVE bootcamp over the course of four days where you can learn Azure SQL from Anna Hoffman and Bob Ward and get your questions answered. Each day, there will be a two-hour live session for you to join. After or during the session, there will also be hands-on labs to complete. By the end of the week, you should be comfortable with the Azure SQL fundamentals (or the "meat and potatoes" of Azure SQL).
