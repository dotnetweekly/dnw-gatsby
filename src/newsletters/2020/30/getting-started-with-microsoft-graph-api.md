It is a common practice for big players in the cloud market to allow their users to have more than one method to access their data. With Google, for example, you can have one single account and easy access to a bunch of free services like Gmail and Drive.

Google also provides public APIs for developers to be able to access data via other applications. The whole process happens through the usual OAuth +, an application provided by the player.
