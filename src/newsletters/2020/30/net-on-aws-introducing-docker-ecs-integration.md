Last week I read about a new Docker ECS Integration experience, and it piqued my interest. I immediately put it onto my list of things to try out and experiment with. After spending an hour or so with the tooling over the weekend, my early impression is that this CLI feature might be quite useful. In this post, I will briefly explain what the integration looks like today and how to get started with it.

Another useful resource is to watch a recording from the recent AWS Cloud Container Conference @ 2hr 18 mins. This includes a session and demo about the integration by Chad Metcalf, from Docker and Carmen Puccio, from AWS.
