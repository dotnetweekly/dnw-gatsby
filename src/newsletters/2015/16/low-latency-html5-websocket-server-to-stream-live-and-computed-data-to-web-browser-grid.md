<span style="font: 14px/normal 'Segoe UI', Arial, sans-serif;color: #111111;text-indent: 0px;letter-spacing: normal;float: none;background-color: #ffffff">Live updates to browser is an important scenario in today's world.  All businesses (Banking, Trading, Healthcare, Retail etc..) rely heavily on internet/browser based apps to reach their esteemed customers.  Be it stock quote, news, mail - live updates bring agility to your web application.  This article is about html5 WebSocket service that streams real time, live data to browser grid.  Also, this service can compute complex math expressions (formula) dynamically (at runtime.)  Say, for example, you need to live update items such as Stock name, symbol, quantity, price, position (short/long) at real time to user browsers - this service can stream it to browser grid.  This service can handle it better than AJAX/ COMET based grids as it uses low latency TCP communication using html5 WebSocket.   If you would like to add few more items that are computed based on other items in your data - well, this websocket server takes up that work for you behind the scenes.</span>
