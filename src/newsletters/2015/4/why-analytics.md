Analytics gives us the ability to understand our users and what they are experiencing, so we can build the right applications for them. It alerts us quickly to any issues and helps us diagnose them rapidly so as to provide users with the best possible service level. Users have high expectations and little tolerance for hiccups, whether your app is an online service aimed at attracting consumers, a phone app intended to entertain people, or internal to your enterprise. Analytics enables us to identify problems early on, diagnose and solve them faster, and continuously improve our applications so they can become an integral part of our usersâ€™ day-to-day routine.
