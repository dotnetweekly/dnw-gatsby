In response to overwhelming user requests, Microsoft has started a project to add support for a React JavaScript component to Visual Studio 2015. Specifically, the project is to add React JSX support. <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html" target="_blank">JSX</a> is the XML-like syntax extension for JavaScript commonly used with the React library. JSX support has long been the No. 1 request on the <a href="http://webessentials.uservoice.com/forums/140520-general/filters/top" target="_blank">Web Essentials User Voice</a> site used to gather feature requests from the user base, garnering more than four times the number of requests of any other project.
