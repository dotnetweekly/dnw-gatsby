Earlier today at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, I provided developers a first look at the Windows 10 developer platform strategy and universal app platform. I encourage you to <a href="http://www.buildwindows.com/">tune in to our Build conference in April</a> for the full story. Windows 10 represents the culmination of our platform convergence journey with Windows now running on a single, unified Windows core. This convergence enables one app to run on every Windows device â€“ on the phone in your pocket, the tablet or laptop in your bag, the PC on your desk, and the Xbox console in your living room.
