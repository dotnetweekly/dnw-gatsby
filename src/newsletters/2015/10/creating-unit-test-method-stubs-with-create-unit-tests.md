In <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/visual-studio-2015-ctp-vs">Visual Studio 2015 CTP 6</a> we are introducing the "Create Unit Tests" feature that provides the ability to create unit test method stubs. The feature allows easy configuration of a test project, and the test class and the test method stub therein. It is conveniently available as a context menu item, and can be invoked on product code at the scope of a method, a type, or a namespace. It launches a fairly self-explanatory dialog that surfaces the options that can be configured (does the look and feel seem familiar to you?). Support is presently for C# and the MSTest framework but enhancements are in the pipeline.
