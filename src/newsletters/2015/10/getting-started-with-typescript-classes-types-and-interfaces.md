One of the big announcements at <a title="ng-conf" href="http://ng-conf.org/" target="_blank">ng-conf</a> this week was the collaborative work that the Angular and TypeScript teams have been doing. Angular 2 will leverage TypeScript heavily and you can as well in any type of JavaScript application (client-side or even server-side with Node.js). You can also use ES6 or ES5 with Angular 2 if you decide that TypeScript isn't for you.
