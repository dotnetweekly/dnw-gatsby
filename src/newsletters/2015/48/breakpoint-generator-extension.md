As developers, we are often confronted with existing, potentially large codebases that we have never seen before but are asked to make changes in.Â It can be a class library received from a colleague or a complete application downloaded from GitHub to reuse or extend. However, before we can start making changes to the code, we need to understand the existing flow of the application. Where does it start, what are the public entry points to the different assemblies that are part of the application solution and so on.
