In web applications, <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/data/gg577609.aspx">Reactive Extensions</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS">RxJS</a> can be viewed as "lodash for asynchronous collections", it offers powerful functional constructs and operators to reduce the complexities when web application features scales with the asynchronous nature of web. It also changes programming model from “pull” to “push”, conceptually unifies the data model and behavior across async-array and events, enables effective data transformation with data streams, ultimately simplifies application state management logic with a cleaner approach.
