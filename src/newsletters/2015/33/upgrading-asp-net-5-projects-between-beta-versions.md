I’ve been trying to keep up with ASP.NET 5 and the various beta releases that have come out over the last months. It looks like we’re in for at least a couple more more beta releases (there are 8 planned and we’re currently on Beta 6 in mid-August). Of all the things that have been frustrating about ASP.NET 5, updating between versions has been the most painful for me.
