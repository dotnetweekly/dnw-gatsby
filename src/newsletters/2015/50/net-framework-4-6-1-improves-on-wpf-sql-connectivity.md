Microsoft's .NET Fundamentals Team a few weeks ago announced a new version of .NET Framework 4.6.1. It includes a number of streamline improvements to Windows Presentation Foundation and SQL Connectivity, to name a few. And just recently, the team also re-emphasized end of support for versions of .NET Framework versions older than 4.5.1.
