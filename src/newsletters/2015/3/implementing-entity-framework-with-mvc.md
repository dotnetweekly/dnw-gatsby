How can Entity Framework (EF) simplify your work? Find out from Adam Tuliper and Christopher Harrison, in this <a href="http://www.microsoftvirtualacademy.com/colleges/Web-Development-Wednesdays" target="_blank">Web Wednesdays</a> course. Almost every website you create is a front-end to a database. So managing that data effectively is key to the success, flexibility, and performance of your application. Plus, a robust object/relational mapping (ORM) tool is critical. This is why EF is such a must-have for developers.
