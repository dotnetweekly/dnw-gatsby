We are very excited to provide built-in support for the Scale Agile Framework using our existing Scrum, Agile, and CMMI templates. Some time ago, we published a whitepaper: <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn798712.aspx">Scaled Agile Framework: Using TFS to support epics, release trains, and multiple backlogs</a>, which detailed how to use TFS to support SAFe practices. In support of that guidance, we also published on the Microsoft Download Center, a set of <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=44222">Process Template Samples with Support for SAFe</a>. With the <a title="May 15 deployment" href="http://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/news/2015-may-15-vso">May 15 deployment</a> of Visual Studio Online, the Agile, Scrum, and CMMI process templates are now updated to include these changes.
