In the world of development, all too often code that "worked on my machine" has an issue when moved to another.  Other times, developers inherit complex code that may have been documented once upon a time, but many changes later, there's little to help.  Visual Studio 2015 has the answers for these scenarios, and in this deep dive, we'll show you how.  You'll see how historical debugging of applications running on your own or even other machines such as QA or production can save you time and effort.  We'll demonstrate ways to map your active debugging sessions to show code paths and relationships, document dependencies, and make changes to complex applications less daunting.
