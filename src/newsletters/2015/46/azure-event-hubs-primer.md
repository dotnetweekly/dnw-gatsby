Event Hubs are part of the Azure Service Bus service and are designed for extremely high speed ingestion of data such as in an IoT environment.  At full scale, they can process 1 million events per second and are the basis for Azureâ€™s Application Insights service.  Event Hubs implement a stream model that can be highly scaled with extremely low latency.
