After publishing the post Load Testing from different geographies with Cloud-based load testing I have Have had a couple of people ask how do you schedule Load Tests.  Depending on what type of load testing you are doing there are two ways to do this. 

For on-premises Load Test then you will need to use the Command line (see bottom of this post)
For Cloud Load Testing we make this simple with the new build System
