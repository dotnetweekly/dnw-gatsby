<a title="http://azure.microsoft.com/services/application-insights/" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/controlpanel/blogs/posteditor.aspx/Application%20Insights">Application Insights</a> now supports collecting telemetry from Windows Phone and Windows Store applications and lets you visualize it in the Azure Preview portal. You can get insights about your users and what they are doing with yourÂ application, as well as diagnose and fix your app crashes. When you add Application Insights to your project, a rich set of data including users, sessions, page views, crashes is collected automatically. In addition, there is an API for you to send custom events, metrics, and exceptions. Let us do a quick walkthrough of the experience. You can also read the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=506944">getting started doc</a> for more details.
