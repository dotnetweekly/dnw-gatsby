In this episode, Robert is joined by Dan Taylor, Angelos Petropoulos and Charles Willis to explore some of the enhancements to the diagnostic tooling in Visual Studio 2015. You'll see how these tools are now brought into the debugging process to make them easier to discover and use, what improvements have been made to IntelliTrace, a new feature named PerfTips that makes it easier to evaluate the performance of your app during debuggingÂ and the new memory usage tool that runs while debugging.
