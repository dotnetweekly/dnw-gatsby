When I started learning design patterns, I was pretty excited at the beauty of design patterns and how applying design patterns correctly can make the application flexible, extensible and maintainable. I was so eager that I browsed codeproject almost everyday to look for new articles on design patterns. And soon I realized most of them explain design patterns individually and not many articles demonstrate usage of design patterns in a complete application.
