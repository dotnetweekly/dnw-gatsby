In this episode, Robert is joined by <a href="https://twitter.com/AndrewBrianHall">Andrew Hall</a>, who shows tips and tricks for debugging multithreaded applications. Computers with multiple processors, multi-core processors, or hyperthreading processes can run multiple threads at the same time. Parallel processing of multiple threads can greatly improve program performance, but it can also make debugging more difficult because it introduces the need to keep track of multiple threads. Andrew shows how you can use features that have been in Visual Studio for several releases to effectively debug multithreaded applications.
