Developers can get access to Azure through a number of subscription methods: Role Based Access Control, DreamSpark, and Cloud Solution Provider, to name a few. That access is granted through the<a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/announcing-the-azure-sdk-2-7-for-net/" target="_blank"> Azure Software Development Kit 2.7</a> that was released at the same time as <a href="https://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2015/07/20/official-visual-studio-2015-net-framework-4-6-rtm.aspx" target="_blank">Visual Studio 2015 mid-July</a>. At the time, support was only built in for Visual Studio 2015. This week, a point-point update extends that support to Visual Studio 2013.
