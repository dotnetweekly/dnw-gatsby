All the deep dive technical sessions (around 600 of them!), rich two-way conversations and excitement of seeing friends and colleagues you haven't seen for a year starts right now at the MVP Global Summit. This year it's bigger than ever. Nearly early half of the 4,000 MVPs from around the world arrived in Bellevue, Washington this weekend for what one MVP described as "like a family reunion, except you like everyone!" Steve Guggenheimer (Guggs), corporate vice president of Microsoft's Developer eXperience & Evangelism (DX) group welcomed them in his blog this morning.
