In my <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/visualstudio/archive/2015/09/28/introducing-u-sql.aspx">last blog post</a>, I introduced U-SQL as the new Big Data query language for the <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/dataplatforminsider/archive/2015/09/28/microsoft-expands-azure-data-lake-to-unleash-big-data-productivity.aspx">Azure Data Lake</a> that unifies the benefits of SQL with the expressive power of your own code. Today we are announcing <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/dataplatforminsider/archive/2015/10/28/sql-server-2016-everything-built-in.aspx">the availability</a> of the Azure Data Lake in public preview. You can now try U-SQL in Visual Studio and run it over massive amounts of data in the store and across relational store such as Azure SQL Database. In this blog post, I will dive a bit deeper into how you can extend U-SQL queries with custom code.
