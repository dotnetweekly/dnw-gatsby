Block predicates are now available as a preview enhancement for <a title="" href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/row-level-security-for-sql-database-is-generally-available/">Row-Level Security</a> (RLS) on Azure SQL Database. Block predicates address a common point of customer feedback, by enabling security policies to prevent users from inserting, updating, and/or deleting rows that violate the predicate. You can try block predicates today on any Azure SQL Database (V12) server.
