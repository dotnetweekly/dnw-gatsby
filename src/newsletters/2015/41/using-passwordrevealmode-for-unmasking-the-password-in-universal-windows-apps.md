If you are building an <a href="http://dailydotnettips.com/tag/universal-windows-app/" target="_blank">Universal Windows Apps</a>, and having a password box that accepts user credentials,  user may often want to unmasked the password to check if correct password was entered or not . We have seen similar feature for most of the password box either in desktop, mobile or web applications. Even previous version of Store or Phone Apps does supports that. However there is a change in Windows 10 Universal app that provide unified experience across the devices and can control the revealed button easily.
