Dev Center has now integrated the functionality previously available in<a href="http://advertising.microsoft.com/en/blog/35230/manage-your-ad-business-from-windows-dev-center">pubCenter</a> to simplify how to create, manage and track your Microsoft advertising ad impressions and revenue. In addition, Microsoft Advertising and Windows ad mediation have been merged into one single SDK, the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=619694">Microsoft Universal Ad Client SDK</a>, which works for apps built for Windows Phone 8.x, Windows 8.x and Windows 10.
