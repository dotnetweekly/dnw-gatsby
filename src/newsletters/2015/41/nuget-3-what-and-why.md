Since Visual Studio 2015 was released in July, developers have started using a new version of NuGet, NuGet 3 We decided to introduce a number of significant changes based on feedback from the community. With any major version change, some things breakâ€¦ and usually for a good reason. We have bugs and issues that we are addressing and want to share what the plan was for versions 3.x and what the plan is for the future.
