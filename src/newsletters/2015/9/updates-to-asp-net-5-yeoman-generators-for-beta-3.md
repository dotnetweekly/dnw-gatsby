With the most recent version of Visual Studio 2015 CTP, CTP 6 this past Monday, there were some great improvements not only in the IDE but also ASP.NET 5. See the article here from Jeff Fritz, or Introducing ASP.NET 5 on Scott Guthrieâ€™s blog, for even more. We have updated the ASP.NET 5 yeoman generators to have the latest content based on ASP.NET 5 beta 3.
