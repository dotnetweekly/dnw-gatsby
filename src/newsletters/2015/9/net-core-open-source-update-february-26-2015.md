It has been a couple weeks since we last reported on the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dotnet/archive/2015/02/03/coreclr-is-now-open-source.aspx">.NET Core open source project</a>. It's been a very fun time, watching more people get involved in the project and to see progress on a daily basis. It's amazing watching my GitHub news feed. I have to scroll through several page views just to get through the last hour (on a weekday) of <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/corefx">corefx</a>, <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr">coreclr</a> and <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn">roslyn</a> repo activity. Today, we're going to focus on the CoreCLR repo.
