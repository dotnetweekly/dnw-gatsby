One of the top <a href="http://visualstudio.uservoice.com/forums/121579-visual-studio/suggestions/2274717-xaml-debugger">requests</a> from developers (reiterated at //BUILD last year) has been tools for inspecting the XAML at runtime. With <a href="http://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/visual-studio-2015-ctp-vs">Visual Studio 2015 CTP6</a> we’re pleased to introduce the new UI debugging tools for XAML. These tools enable you to inspect the visual tree of your running WPF application as well as the properties on any element in the tree, turning the difficult challenge of picking apart how properties override each other and figuring out winning behavior into a straightforward task that’s done at runtime, when everything is taken into account. Visual Studio integrates these UI debugging tools directly into the debugging experience so they fit seamlessly into the development cycle.
