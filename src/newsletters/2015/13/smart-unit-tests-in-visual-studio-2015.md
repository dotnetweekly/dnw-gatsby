Over the years, we have seen a lot of enhancements in different versions of Visual Studio. Visual Studio provides many tools like Static Code Analysis, Code Metrics, IntelliTrace, Code Profiler, Unit Testing mechanism, Code Map etc. that facilitates writing code the right way. All these tools come integrated in Visual Studio, depending on the version you are using. You can read an article authored by Subodh which talks about Code Optimization Tools in Visual Studio 2013.
