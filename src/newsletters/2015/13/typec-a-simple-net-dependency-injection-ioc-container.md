TypeC is a simple .NET type container for resolving interfaces/abstract base classes to their concrete implementations. TypeC implements factory method for instantiating types. Only one container can exist in a given .NET AppDomain as it is a singleton implementation. Multiple concrete child types can be mapped to the same base class through namespace support.
