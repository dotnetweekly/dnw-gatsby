In Part 1 of this series I introduced you with Less and Sass. In the example you developed in Part 1, you used Node Package Manager (npm) to install Less and Sass. Any package manager basically does the job of pulling requested files from some repository and place them on your local machine. The files under consideration could be binaries (*.dll, *.exe etc.), source code files (*.js, *.cs etc.) or even documentation files (*.html, *.doc etc.). The files you receive is totally dependent on the "package" you are installing.
