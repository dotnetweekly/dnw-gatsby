If you want to explore machine learning, sometimes the hardest part is finding an interesting data set to play with. In this post, I want to tackle how to find and use interesting data in Azure Machine Learning (AzureML).  I’ll discuss using the sample datasets, importing data, and finding some interesting data sources. If you don’t have an Azure account yet, you can sign up for a Microsoft Azure Free Trial.
