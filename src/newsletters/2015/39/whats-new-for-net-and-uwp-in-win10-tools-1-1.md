Last week we updated the Visual Studio tools for Universal Windows Apps. The easiest way to get the update is within Visual Studio, under Tools &gt; Extensions &gt; Updates. (Also read the release notes). As part of this update, we're including a new opt-in pre-release feature that will shrink the size of your app.Â In this article I'll tell you the what and why and how of this new feature.
