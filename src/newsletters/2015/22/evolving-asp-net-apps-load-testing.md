Creating performance benchmarks is hard. There are so many variables that can affect performance that it can be nearly impossible to get consistent results. Difficulty aside, I made some claims that the original data grid implementation was not optimal and that our new implementation would be more efficient. I would like to at least attempt to prove this with some repeatable load tests.
