There is a preview of an extension for Visual Studio 2015 (the release candidate at the time of this writing) that adds Docker support. If you have VS2015 RC you can get the Docker Extension here. You can certainly manage things from the command line, but I think as you go through this post you'll appreciate the convenience of this extension.
