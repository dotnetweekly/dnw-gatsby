If you got the windows 8.1 store app and you want to move it to Windows 10 UAP, you can easily do that with some minor changes as Windows 10 UAP is a super set of winRT. You have to do some UI work to make your app look great on small devices. Underline code is almost compatible with Windows 10 UAP. If you got a Universal winRT app then you have to do some more work on adaptivity as only a single binary is created with windows 10 UAP which is going to run across all the devices, You donâ€™t have to rewrite all the code but you have to just reorganize things.
