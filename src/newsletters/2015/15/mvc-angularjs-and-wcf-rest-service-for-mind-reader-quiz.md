A Mind Reader Quiz game is a quiz game where users can think of any one of his dream stars from the list of names. In an online quiz there will be some limited questions with Yes or No options that the users will be asked related to his dream star. Depending on the user's answer the system will finally find the person in the user's mind and produce the result. In my online quiz application (Shanu-Who's In Your Mind Reader) users can think of a famous person from the list from the Main Page. I will determine who's in your mind.
