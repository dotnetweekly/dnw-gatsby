With the start of a new season of Game of Thrones, folks are sitting on the edge of their seats waiting to see whatâ€™s coming. Unlike the Khaleesi who seems to be going nowhere fast, Node.js Tools for Visual Studio (NTVS) has made some moves recently. Over the last month, we released <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/visualstudio/archive/2015/03/25/node-js-tools-1-0-for-visual-studio.aspx">Node.js Tools 1.0 for Visual Studio</a>, joined the vibrant open source community on <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/nodejstools">GitHub</a>, and created VM images so anyone can quickly get started with NTVS.
