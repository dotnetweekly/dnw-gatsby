I'm sure you all know that Build 2015 is happening this week, and we all expect a number of announcements, releases, news, etc.
Given the very limited number of tickets, I'm willing to bet only a few of you were able to get them, and so attend in person.

But I've got a deal for you! (Actually two!).
