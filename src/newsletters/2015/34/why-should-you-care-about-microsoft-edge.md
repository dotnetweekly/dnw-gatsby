This post is a short intro to a 5-part mini-series. Microsoft Edge is our browser for the new, modern web built exclusively for Windows 10. It’s engineered to enable you to go beyond browsing the web and to start experiencing a more personal and productive web. It’s not packed with legacy support. Nor will it render your site differently based on some flags. It will however treat your site the way it’s meant to – assuming you’ve done your part. The thing is though – Edge will be installed on every Windows 10 installation.
Every. Single. One.
