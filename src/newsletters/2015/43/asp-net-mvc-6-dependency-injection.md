ASP.NET MVC 6 comes with a basic dependency injection container that will allow you to implement constructor and property dependency injection into your controller classes. This may be enough for smaller ASP.NET MVC 6 applications while other applications can continue to use Autofac, Ninject, StructureMap, Unity, etc.
