I'm excited to announce the .NET Server SDK for App Service Mobile is now open source on GitHub! This follows the open-sourcing of the Node.js Server SDK last month. The client libraries for iOS, Android, Xamarin, and Windows have been open source for quite some time, so with this release, all Azure Mobile SDKs are open source!
