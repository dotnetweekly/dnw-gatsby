Several new tools are now available from the NuGet team. It worked with several teams at Microsoft to deliver a new version of the NuGet client to support the Universal Windows Platform (UWP) and the new Portable Class Libraries (PCLs). The new NuGet tools are available through Tools | Extensions and Updates | Update in Visual Studio 2015, as well as the NuGet distribution site at <a href="http://bit.ly/1MgNt2J">bit.ly/1MgNt2J</a>. NuGet has also released a new version of the NuGet command-line tool you can download from the same location on dist.nuget.org.
