On behalf of the Microsoft Edge team, Iâ€™m thrilled to welcome you to the brand new Microsoft Edge Dev Blog, now part of the Windows Blogs family! Like the IEBlog before it, this is where the Microsoft Edge team will share with you the latest on our activities, including the latest updates to the browser and the evolution of our product vision. You will also see a regular stream of technical, deep-dive content in an effort to further our goal of building an open conversation with web developers and enthusiasts.
