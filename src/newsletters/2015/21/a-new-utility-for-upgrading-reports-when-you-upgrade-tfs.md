When upgrading TFS to a new version, one set of items that are not upgraded are the already deployed reports for existing projects. The existing reports will continue to work but we’ve made a large number of performance enhancements and other minor tweaks, especially on the “X” Overview reports (in each project there are a couple of rollup reports that are specific to the template but which all work the same way).
