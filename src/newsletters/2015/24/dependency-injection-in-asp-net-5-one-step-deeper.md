Dependency Injection has always been an integral part of all the web frameworks under the umbrella of the ASP.NET: Web API, SignlaR, and MVC. But historically, these frameworks evolved separately from each other, hence each of these frameworks had its own way of supporting Dependency Injection, even with Katana‘s trial to bring these frameworks together through OWIN, you still needed to do some hackery to have a unified container that supports them all at once. Well, things have changed!
