Data binding is a popular concept in programming these days, especially for client applications. In this article, I’ll discuss what data binding is and how it’s used in technologies that support it natively, such as Windows XAML. After I cover the basic principles of data binding and observable properties, and how these can be used in technologies that don’t support data binding “out of the box,” I’ll show how data binding support can be added to Xamarin.Android and Xamarin.iOS with the MVVM Light Toolkit (<a id="ctl00_MTContentSelector1_mainContentContainer_ctl03" href="http://mvvmlight.net/">mvvmlight.net</a>).
