There's been a lot of enthusiasm lately about the direction that ASP.NET is going lately, and rightfully so.Â However, while ASP.NET 5 is cool and exciting, it's also not yet released (at the time of this writing, Beta 8 is being worked on). There are very cool things happening around <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/VisualStudio2015ReleasedPlusASPNET5Roadmap.aspx">ASP.NET 4.6 which is released and ready to go live today</a>. Something else that's VERY cool that I want to explore today is <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/webdev/archive/2015/09/04/introducing-microsoft-asp-net-webhooks-preview.aspx"><strong>ASP.NET WebHooks</strong></a>, which just came out as a preview and is being actively worked on.
