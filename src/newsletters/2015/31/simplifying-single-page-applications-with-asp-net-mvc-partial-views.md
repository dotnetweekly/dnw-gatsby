In the MVC pattern, Views are supposed to be so brain-dead simple that they don't require testing: all your logic should be in your Controller, which can be tested using test-driven development (TDD) tools. In addition, in the MVC pattern, program logic and presentation are supposed to be loosely coupled. In ASP.NET MVC, changes to the way the application presents itself should only require changes to the HTML in the relevant View -- not changes to the application's program logic. In another <a href="https://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2015/07/01/structuring-views.aspx" target="_blank">column</a> I showed how to leverage ASP.NET Partial Views to achieve those goals.
