Today is an exciting day for Windows users and developers alike with the launch of <a href="http://www.windows.com/">Windows 10</a>.  For developers, Windows 10 represents the culmination of our platform convergence journey with Windows running on a single, unified Windows core. This convergence enables one app targeting the Universal Windows Platform to run on every Windows device – on the phone in your pocket, the tablet or laptop in your bag, the PC on your desk, and the Xbox console in your living room. And that’s not even mentioning all the new devices being added to the Windows family, including the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-hololens/en-us">HoloLens</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-surface-hub/en-us">Surface Hub</a>, and IoT devices like the <a href="http://blogs.windows.com/buildingapps/2015/02/02/windows-10-coming-to-raspberry-pi-2/">Raspberry Pi 2</a>. All these Windows devices will access one unified Store for app acquisition, distribution and updates.
