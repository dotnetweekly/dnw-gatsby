Today we release Visual Studio Tools for Unity 2.0 Preview 2. VSTU is Microsoftâ€™s free Visual Studio add-on that enables a rich programming and debugging experience for working with the <a href="http://unity3d.com/">Unity gaming tools and platform</a>. The main feature of Visual Studio Tools for Unity 2.0 Preview 2 is the official support for <a href="http://unity3d.com/5">Unity 5</a>, the new major version of Unity that was released last month.
