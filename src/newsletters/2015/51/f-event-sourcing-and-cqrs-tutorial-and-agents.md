Last year I wrote a post about Pure Functional Application for the F# advent calendar, I really think it is a great initiative so I signed up again. This is my contribution to this year's F# advent calendar, you can find all the other excellent posts on @sergey_tihon's blog: https://sergeytihon.wordpress.com/tag/fsadvent/
