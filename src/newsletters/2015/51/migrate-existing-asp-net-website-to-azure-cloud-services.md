Do you have an existing ASP.NET website that you'd like to deploy on Azure and get the benefits of Azure's Platform as a Service capabilities? The easiest and quickest option is to use <a title="Azure Web Apps" href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/app-service/web/">Azure Web Apps</a>. Azure Web Apps gives you create flexibility but it does not allow you to customize the underlying operating system that much. For instance, if your existing ASP.NET website has a dependency on applications being installed into the web server, Web Apps may not be the best option.
