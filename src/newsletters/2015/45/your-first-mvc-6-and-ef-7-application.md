In <a href="http://www.binaryintellect.net/articles/895b33a8-0827-4e54-83d6-4938c46810b4.aspx">Part 1</a> of this series you created and configured a basic project using ASP.NET MVC 6. Although the project runs as expected and outputs a message in the browser, it isn't database driven yet. In this part we will add database support to the project in the following ways:
<ul>
	<li>Display a list of customers from the Northwind database</li>
	<li>Allow for modification of existing customers</li>
	<li>Provide basic validation capabilities</li>
</ul>
