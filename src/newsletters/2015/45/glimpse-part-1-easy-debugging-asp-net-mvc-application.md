With increasing business demands now we develop very large and complex ASP.NET projects that take more time to compile and debug. And whenever QA reports any issue, we need to compile and debug the code with exact scenario. Then only we figure out the debugging information like which route, controller, model, view, class and DB queries with parameter values that help us in finding the root cause of an issue.
