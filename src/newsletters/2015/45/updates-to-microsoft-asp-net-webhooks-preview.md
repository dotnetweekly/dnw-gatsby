We just released Beta4 of ASP.NET WebHooks Preview with a nice set of new features based on feedback and help from the community! Always let us know what you think – either by raising a issue on GitHub or pinging me on twitter. You can get the update from nuget.org by looking for the packages under Microsoft.AspNet.WebHooks.*. If you haven’t heard about ASP.NET WebHooks then you may want to look at Introducing Microsoft ASP.NET WebHooks Preview.
