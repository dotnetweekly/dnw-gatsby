A major challenge in any web application is implementing its security. In traditional web development with ASP.NET (from version 2.0 onwards), we have been using Membership and Role providers. These providers allows us to define Roles, Users and assign roles to users which helps us to manage Authorization. But with an increase in social networking and global authentication providers, we needed an upgraded membership system. ASP.NET Identity is the new membership system for building ASP.NET web applications, phone, store, or hybrid applications using social identities for authentication and authorization.
