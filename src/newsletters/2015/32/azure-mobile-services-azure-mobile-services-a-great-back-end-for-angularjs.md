AngularJS is a great framework for building JavaScript applications for both Web and mobile. It’s very powerful, but it does come with a bit of a learning curve. To get started, I read blogs and books and watched video courses, which are great for learning client-side features, such as forms, routing and validation. Unfortu­nately, the client-side topics always seem to overshadow back-end concerns. Most learning resources barely touch on these at all.
