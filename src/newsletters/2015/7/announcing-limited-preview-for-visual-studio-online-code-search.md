<span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size: small">Today we are unveiling a limited preview of our new Code Search feature on Visual Studio Online.  Code Search enables you to quickly and easily search across your entire account and find matches using your web browser.  Not only can you perform full text matching but for some languages, like C#,  C and C++, and additional ones in the future, it understands the structure of your code and allows you to search for specific contexts, like class definitions, comments, properties, etc.</span>
