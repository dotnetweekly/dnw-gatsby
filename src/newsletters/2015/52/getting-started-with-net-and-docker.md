Docker lets you build and run apps, more quickly, with less hardware. That’s why application container technology (and Docker in particular) is so popular. You can run hundreds of containers on a server which could only run a handful of VMs, and containers are fast to deploy and can be versioned like the software they run. If you work in the Microsoft space, you might think containers are The Other Guy’s technology (think LAMP, Node or Java), but actually you can run .NET apps in Docker containers today. In this post, I’ll show you how.
