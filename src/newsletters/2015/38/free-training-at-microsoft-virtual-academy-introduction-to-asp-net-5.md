In 2013, Jon Galloway, Damian Edwards, and myself went up to film a LIVE 8 hour long Microsoft Virtual Academy training session called "Building Web Apps with ASP.NET Jump Start." We returned in 2014 with "Building Modern Web Apps with ASP.NET." Both of these are free, and are effectively a full day each of content.
