By Using the Concurrency Visualizer, you can examine how your multithreaded app performs. The views in the Concurrency Visualizer provide graphical, tabular, and textual data that shows the temporal relationships between the threads in your program and the system as a whole. You can use the Concurrency Visualizer to locate performance bottlenecks, CPU underutilization, thread contention, cross-core thread migration, synchronization delays, DirectX, activity, areas of overlapped I/O, and other information.
