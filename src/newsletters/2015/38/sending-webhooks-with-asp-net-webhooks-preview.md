In the blog <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/webdev/archive/2015/09/04/introducing-microsoft-asp-net-webhooks-preview.aspx">Introducing Microsoft ASP.NET WebHooks Preview</a>, we gave an overview of how to work with Microsoft ASP.NET WebHooks. We mentioned that it is not only possible to <em>receive</em> WebHooks from others but also to add support for <em>sending</em>WebHooks from your Web Application. This blog goes into detail on how to do that.
