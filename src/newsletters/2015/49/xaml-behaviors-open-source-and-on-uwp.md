Your requests to grow the XAML Behaviors platform and bring them forward to support UWP app development have been heard. Today we announce the next step: XAML Behaviors natively supported for UWP and shipping as a NuGet package (for both <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Xaml.Behaviors.Uwp.Native/">native</a> and <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Xaml.Behaviors.Uwp.Managed/">managed</a> projects). Additionally, to build a vibrant community around the platform, <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/XamlBehaviors/">Behaviors are open source and on GitHub</a>. Now, you can help influence the future direction of Behaviors.
