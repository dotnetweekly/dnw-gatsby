Today at the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en/convergence/">Convergence Conference</a> in Spain, <a href="http://blogs.microsoft.com/?p=62871">Bill Staples announced</a>Â <a href="http://www.powerapps.com/">PowerApps</a>. The team I work on doesn't just make ASP.NET, we also make tools and services for Azure App Service and for the last year the team has been building PowerApps. PowerApps makes it easy to quickly create new business apps, connect systems and then share those apps with anyone on your team.
