In this episode, Robert is joined by <a href="https://twitter.com/MadsTorgersen">Mads Torgersen</a>, who takes us on a tour of the new features in C# 6 that aim at making your everyday code cleaner and clearer. Mads has spoken on this subject at both <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2015/3-711">Build</a> and <a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Ignite/2015/BRK3700">Ignite</a>. Mindful of this, Robert and Mads go beyond the demos and also talk about how and why C# gained these features as well as what role the open-source <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn">.NET Compiler Platform</a> ("Roslyn") plays.
