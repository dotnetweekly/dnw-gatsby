Wow. Just wow. I don’t know of a better way to describe my feelings right now. Open source is probably one of the most energizing projects our team has been working on. It’s been a blast so far and the stream of enthusiastic contributors and interactions doesn’t seem to stop any time soon. In this post, I want to give you a long overdue update on where we are, interesting changes we made, and give an overview of what’s coming next. Read to the end, this is a post you don’t want to miss.
