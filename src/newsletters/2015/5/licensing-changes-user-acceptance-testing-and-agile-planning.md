This is next in a series of <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/bharry/archive/2014/12/10/more-pricing-and-licensing-changes-coming.aspx">licensing and feature changes</a> that I laid out in December.  With this, I think all of the cloud changes (and more) that I described have been made.  Some of the on-prem changes will be available as we release more on-prem updates.
