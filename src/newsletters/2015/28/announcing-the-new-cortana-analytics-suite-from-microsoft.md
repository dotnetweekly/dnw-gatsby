Earlier today, at our <a href="https://wpc.microsoft.com/en/us/">Worldwide Partner Conference</a> (WPC) in Orlando, our CEO Satya Nadella announced the new <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/cortanaanalytics">Cortana Analytics Suite</a> as part of his keynote address. Data, as we all recognize, can be a huge differentiator for any businesses – provided, of course, that they tap into such data for critical and actionable insights. The new Cortana Analytics Suite will help enterprises accomplish this by delivering on the promise of big data and advanced analytics.
