After my last post on upcoming ALM Webinars i received a bunch of emails about other great ALM and DevOps eventsâ€¦So i spent some time putting them in chronological order. Hope this helps next time you are considering re-watching an old series on Netflix or increasing your knowledge about emerging trends in the DevOps space.
