Since that last look at ASP.NET 5 in December there have been two more preview releases of ASP.NET 5: Beta2 with Visual Studio 2015 CTP 5, and Beta3 with Visual Studio 2015 CTP 6. With each release, the framework continues to evolve and improve. In many cases, these improvements were generously contributed by the .NET community through the public ASP.NET project on GitHub (bit.ly/1DaY7Cd). In this article, I’ll take a deeper look under the hood of the new ASP.NET 5 runtime to see what’s changed in the most recent release.
