Visual Studio 2015 is finally delivering the results of project Roslyn â€“ an ambitious attempt at rewriting the C# and Visual Basic compilers as a service. One of the benefits is the support for diagnostic analyzers in the code editor. They are small pieces of code for validating and refactoring different aspects of source code, which can easily be written by any developer wanting to improve his development experience in Visual Studio.
