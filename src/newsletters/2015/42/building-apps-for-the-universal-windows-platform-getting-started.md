I have seen a ton of videos on the magic of the Universal Windows Platform (UWP) and how we can now write the same code to target a multitude of devices. Let's face it though, I'm a dev, I want to see how it's done (and as an extension that it is indeed possible). Queuing off of some feedback from a video on XAML improvements, we decided to make a real application that simultaneously targets the client, the phone, and a Raspberry PI 2 with the same codebase. It turns out that it isn't all that magical at all.
