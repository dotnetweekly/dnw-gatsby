Mads is a terrific person so I thought I would stop in to bug him about C#. For the first 15-20 minutes he mentions some of the C# 6 features you should be already using. For the balance of the video he talks about where C# is headed and some of the thinking behind some new features. Obviously it is early, but in this new era of openness (the compiler has literally been open source'd) it is refreshing to actually get inside the fortress to see strategy. The best part is you can add your voice to the process!
