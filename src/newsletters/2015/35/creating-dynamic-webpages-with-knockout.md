Do you build for the web? If you do, you know that creating a webpage which uses dynamic data can be a challenge! There often isn't a clear separation between logic and user interface, and this can make building and maintaining pages tough. Help is here, in the form of <i><a href="http://knockoutjs.com/" target="_blank">Knockout</a></i>, a JavaScript library built to make binding data to a page easier, allowing you to focus on solving business problems rather than on the required technology.
