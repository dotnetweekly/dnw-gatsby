It has been a busy two days here at Build 2015 in San Francisco. Lots of announcements by Microsoft overall, and lots of great stuff for developers (across all platforms). Oh, and if you didnâ€™t feel a little giddy after seeing the HoloLens demo, you should definitely check your pulse. I want to cover some of the integration and extensibility related features that were announced for Visual Studio Online (VSO) and Team Foundation Server (TFS). Everything we are doing in this space is about <strong>enabling teams to weave together the right set of tools and services to create a perfect (or nearly perfect) development environment</strong>.
