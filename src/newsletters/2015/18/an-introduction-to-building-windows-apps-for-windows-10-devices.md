You have lived to see it: a single Windows OS that can run across every type of Windows device. It has a single device platform to enable true universal hardware drivers and a single application platform to enable true universal Windows apps. Years in the making, this is a significant engineering accomplishment. At the OS level, this means a single, maintainable and agile code base. For developers, it provides a unified, reliable API surface across every Windows device, from Internet of Things (IoT) devices such as Raspberry Pi to phone, Xbox, tablet, Surface Hub, laptop, PC and more (like Microsoft HoloLens).
