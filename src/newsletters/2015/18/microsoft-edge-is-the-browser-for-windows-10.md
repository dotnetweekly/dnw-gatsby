This morning, Joe Belfiore took to the stage at Build 2015 to share more about the next chapter in our story for Windows 10, including revealing more about “Project Spartan,” our new default browser for Windows.

We’re excited to share Joe’s announcement that Project Spartan’s official name is Microsoft Edge. You’ll see this name coming in future Insider Preview builds of Windows 10, and coming to our web developer resources very soon.
