Last week I got a chance to talk to Carl and Richard about my experiences with ASP.NET 5. The good, the bad and the obnoxious. Ok maybe none of the latter. We had a great discussion on why we need a reboot on ASP.NET and how the process of building ASP.NET has affected developers trying to keep up with the 'beta' releases.
