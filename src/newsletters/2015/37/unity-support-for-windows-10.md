Today, <a href="http://blogs.unity3d.com/2015/09/08/unity-5-2-easy-access-to-unity-services/">Unity announced the release of Unity 5.2 </a>which includes support for Windows 10 and the Universal Windows Platform (UWP). With UWP support in Unity 5.2, developers can build a single game for Windows 10 that targets multiple devices ranging from phones to tablets to PCs to Xbox.Â  This means that multiple screen sizes and resolutions, different device capabilities, and a wide range of aspect ratios are all supported within a single game.
