Index Advisor is a new Azure SQL Database feature that helps you improve the performance of your databases by optimizing the database index design and layout. Index Advisor allows you to get better performance for your key queries and reduce the overall DTU utilization for your database without having to spend a ton of time and effort doing the analysis and optimizations yourself.
