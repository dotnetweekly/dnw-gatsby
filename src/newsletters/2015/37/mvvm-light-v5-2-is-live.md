It is possible to add MVVM Light to an existing application using the Nuget package manager. This can be done over command line, or using the UI included in Visual Studio. There are two packages to consider when selecting MVVM Light in an existing application: MVVM Light “libraries only” (mvvmlightlibs) and MVVM Light “full package” (mvvmlight) which also adds some files and scaffolding to the application.
