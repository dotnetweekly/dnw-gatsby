Further, getting a quick understanding of the impact of a potential code change is an important aspect of deciding whether the change makes sense, and if so, what its likely cost will be. Both goals require an ability to understand the architecture of your application and analyze the dependencies surfaced there. To tackle the first goal, you typically work from the top and drill down. To tackle the second, you generally work from a specific code element and expand up.
