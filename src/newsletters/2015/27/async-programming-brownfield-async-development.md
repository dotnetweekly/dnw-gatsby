When the Visual Studio Async CTP came out, I was in a fortunate position. I was the sole developer for two relatively small greenfield applications that would benefit from async and await. During this time, various members of the MSDN forums including myself were discovering, discussing and implementing several asynchronous best practices. The most important of those practices are compiled into my March 2013 MSDN Magazinearticle, “Best Practices in Asynchronous Programming” (<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/magazine/jj991977">msdn.microsoft.com/magazine/jj991977</a>).
