A wonderful tool for improving your application's performance.
Optimize your database queries and your usage of Entity Framework. 
The Entity Framework Profiler can evaluate your project from behind the scenes, inspect queries and data access patterns and point you toward problematic spots.
The Entity Framework Profiler can link a specific line of code to an expensive query and help time and a lot of cursing.
