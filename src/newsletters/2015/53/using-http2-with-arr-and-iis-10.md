I was asked a question about if the Application Request Router supports the HTTP 2 protocol on IIS 10 (not sure what it will be called).  I was pretty confident that it did, but nothing beats a test to confirm it.  So that is what I did.  I used this article here that contains some good information about HTTP/2 on IIS 10.  As I read through the instructions, the only requirement for using the HTTP/2 protocol is that the request is made over HTTPS.  And of course, you need IIS 10â€¦
