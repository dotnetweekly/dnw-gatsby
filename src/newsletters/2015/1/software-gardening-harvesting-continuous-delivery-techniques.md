How do you determine the right time to harvest or release your application? Applying <em>Agile</em>, you release often. In fact, every two weeks is very common. This schedule helps you know that the application is not overly ripe. But that doesnâ€™t help you know that application is actually properly ripened and ready for release. What does help you know if the code is ready for release, is by applying <strong>Continuous Delivery</strong> techniques.
