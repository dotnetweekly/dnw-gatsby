In this post series I want to demonstrate how to create a full blown application end-to-end which uses Angular JS on the client, ASP.NET vNext and/or Node JS on the server. Architectural patterns that I am going to use are command query responsibility segregation (CQRS), event sourcing (ES) and (some light) domain driven design (DDD). As a write store we will use GetEventStore. For our read models we use MongoDB and ElasticSearch.

I will develop the application on Linux Ubuntu 14.10 and also show that it runs without modifications on Windows 8.1 or Windows Server 2012.
