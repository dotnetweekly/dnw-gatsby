Not everyone knows Microsoft Azure has the Cross-Platform Command-Line Interface (xplat-cli) for managing Azure Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) and Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) services, but it does. For years, Microsoft has advocated using Windows PowerShell as a scripting language, which worked well for provisioning cloud-based resources. But now that more developers are involved in deploying and moving applications to the cloud, it makes more sense to use JavaScript. The Azure Service Management REST APIs make this cross-platform implementation easier. The official Azure xplat-cli is implemented on top of Node.js, the same runtime often used to build high-performance Web sites and APIs with JavaScript.
