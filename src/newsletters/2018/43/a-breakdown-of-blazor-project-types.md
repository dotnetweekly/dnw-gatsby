Blazor is a single-page web application (SPA) framework built on .NET that runs in the browser with Mono's WebAssembly run-time, or server-side via SignalR. Blazor features a component architecture, routing, a virtual DOM, and a JavaScript Interoperability (interop) API. Currently, Blazor is in an experimental state which allows for rapid development, iterations, and as implied, experimentation.
