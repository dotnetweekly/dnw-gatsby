Filtering an item from a list of items is easy but if the item to filter is not known at compile time then filtering a list will be little complicated.

Instead of writing dynamic filtering in C#, one might go for a Stored Procedure and write a dynamic query based on the input column name and execute the dynamic SQL statement.
