This is the 2nd post in a series of articles on creating performant and scalable web APIs using ASP.NET Core 2.0. In this post weâ€™ll focus on tools that can help us profile and monitor our API so that we can spot any performance and scalability issues before our customers do.

Often, like most bugs, the earlier in the development cycle we find a performance or scalability problem, the quicker and easier it is to fix. So, it is important to make use of these tools from the start of the development cycle as well as when the API is in production.
