Version 3.0 of the Service Fabric .NET NuGet packages are now available with .NET Standard 2.0 support. In this release the Service Fabric NuGet packages also continue to support earlier versions of .NET Framework, down to 4.5.2. Support for full cross-platform .NET Core 2.0 services is coming out incrementally. In this release, .NET Core 2.0 services are only supported on Service Fabric for Windows. Full cross-platform support for .NET Core 2.0 services on Windows and Linux is coming soon.
