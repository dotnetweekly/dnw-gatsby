iOS 11 has introduced a few new visual design updates that you may want to take advantage of, including safe area layout guides and large titles. For Xamarin.iOS developers, we’ve recently published an iOS 11 guide for updating your Xamarin.iOS apps and articles for safe area and large titles. Of course, since Xamarin.Forms is a layer running on top of Xamarin.iOS, all of these features are immediately available to you!

In this post I’ll show you how we’re going a step further to make using these features even easier for you directly in Xamarin.Forms.
