In a past life, I was a web developer. In this post, I’d like to take an outsiders perspective on a couple of developments that I think will be hugely disruptive in the coming years. The first of these is .NET Core making it possible to run .NET websites on cheap hosting.

The second is Blazor, which promises to let us use .NET for front-end web scripting – replacing Javascript. This post is a bit more soapbox-y than usual, so bear with me!
