I've been digging into Vue.js a lot lately. I'm working on a new course on it that will be released on May 1st.

Coming from Angular and Angular.js, I was surprised to see that remote views were not supported out of the box. Now I'm not using it with Webpack or Browserfy, so I am probably using it outside the norm. But I still think remote views (or in the case of hosting in ASP.NET, generated views) are a powerful idea.
