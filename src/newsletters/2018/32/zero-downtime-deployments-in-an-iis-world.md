We live in a digital world where service downtime is not tolerated by customers, but at the same time, not everyone has the luxury of cold standby environments or Kubernetes clusters to enable this. I recently had the task of finding a way to make zero downtime deployments work using good old Microsoft IIS, as well as automating the deployments behind a single click. I’m sure there are others out there with similar constraints. If you’re one of them, then this is for you.
