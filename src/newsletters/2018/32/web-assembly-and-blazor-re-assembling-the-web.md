The Web has been powered by a single language on the client since the very beginnings of the Web as a platform. JavaScript started as an overly simplified scripting language in the first Netscape browsers and slowly evolved over the years to become what is now the most widely used programming language anywhere. A lot has changed and in recent years JavaScript has gotten a lot more powerful with many much needed improvements added in ES2015 and later, as well as improvements in build tools that have made it possible to build and manage even very large code bases.
