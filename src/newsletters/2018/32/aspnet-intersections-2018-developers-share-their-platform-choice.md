Developers choose from a wide range of technologies when building an ASP.NET application. These choices vary on the server-side (i.e. ASP.NET Web Forms versus ASP.NET MVC). These choices also vary on the client-side (i.e. Angular versus React). And with ASP.NET Core they now have more opportunities to use these technologies in both Windows and Linux.

Recently, we conducted a survey that asked a series of questions relating to development with ASP.NET. We learned that, while Blazor awareness is still relatively low (understandable, considering how new it is) that ASP.NET Core is quickly becoming mainstream, that ASP.NET Web Forms is still a popular framework, but Angular and WebAPI is a suitable alternative, and more.

Read on to learn more about which frameworks your colleagues around the world are using and/or targeting in the next 12 months.
