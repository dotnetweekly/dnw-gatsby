It's been 9 months since the release of 2.3 RTM and the 2.3.1 bug fix. The length of time is an indicator of the relative stability of the 2.3 release train; most of the features shipped in 2.4 are usability-related. This includes features like improved test method display name formatting, support for reporting results to VSTS, and additional command line options for the console runner.
