I'm really pleased to announce that my latest Pluralsight course has just been released: Microsoft Azure Developer: Deploying and Managing Containers. And the great thing is that you can watch it free even if you're not a Pluralsight subscriber! This is because it's being made available as part of the superb Microsoft Learn platform.
