Have you had to design general purpose “metadata” tables in your SQL database that basically store column names and values? Do you often serialize/de-serialize XML or JSON from your SQL tables to handle volatile schemas and data? .NET developers have traditionally worked with relational database management systems (RDMS) like SQL Server. RDMS systems have withstood the test of time and are production-ready. Like many tools, however, RDMS systems aren’t always the best solution. You may benefit from a different approach called NoSQL. Contrary to popular belief, NoSQL doesn’t mean “NO SQL” but rather “Not Only SQL.”
