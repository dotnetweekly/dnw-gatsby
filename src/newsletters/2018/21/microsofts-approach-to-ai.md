Although AI has been around for decades it is only recently that companies and organizations are starting to adopt it at scale.  In my previous post I wrote about the new generation of technology building blocks that will shape the future of digital experiences with a specific focus on Artificial Intelligence, and what is driving the rapid expansion of this capability. In this post I will build on that conversation to discuss how Microsoft currently approaches AI from a business perspective.  Before we go into the details, be sure to revisit the first post in this series for context on why AI is taking off now.
