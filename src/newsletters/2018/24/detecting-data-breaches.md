It used to be that we would say, “It’s not a matter of if, but when, we will be breached.” The reality is that when many of us said it, we still thought we’d be the ones who wouldn’t be compromised. Today’s a far different world. Now we operate with the understanding that we’re likely already breached, and it’s a matter of finding out where and shutting things down, if we can.
