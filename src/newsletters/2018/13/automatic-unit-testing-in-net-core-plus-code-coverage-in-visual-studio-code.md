I was talking to Toni Edward Solarin on Skype yesterday about his open source spike (early days) of Code Coverage for .NET Core called "coverlet." There's a few options out there for cobbling together .NET Core Code Coverage but I wanted to see if I could use the lightest tools I could find and make a "complete" solution for Visual Studio Code that would work for .NET Core cross platform. I put my own living spike of a project up on GitHub.
