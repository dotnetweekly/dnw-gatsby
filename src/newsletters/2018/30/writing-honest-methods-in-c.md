We developers spend lot of our time reading code. We read code so that we know how to change it to implement a new feature, fix a bug, etc. It is much better to work in a code base where code is easy to read and understand.

One thing that can make code readable is good naming. Giving variables, classes, and methods good names makes code easier to read.
