With each Rider release, we do our best to bridge the gap between Rider and the ReSharper Ultimate bundle. The top in-demand feature has certainly been “Rider + dotCover” integration. So, without further ado, please welcome the latest Rider 2018.2 EAP build – the first Rider version ever that features unit test code coverage and support for continuous testing!
