MVVM and XAML has failed me. A promise of abstracting to make reusable components, but they never get reused. Layers of complexity for virtually no benefit. If reuse is to happen as planned, it would require almost mystical level foresight into the future, across multiple projects. In the real world, our apps are self contained, and we donâ€™t reuse.
