I’ve recently watched a pretty decent tutorial about DSC on Microsoft Virtual Academy. I’m not a huge fan of video tutorials because it always takes more time to watch them than read a book/blog post (you can hack it by increasing video speed and save yourself a couple of minutes) but sometimes there is additional beneficial side effect - the presenter can show you (accidentally or not) some tips and tricks not strictly related to the core subject of the video. This post is an attempt of summarizing tricks from the DSC tutorial and my former knowledge about GUI tools associated with PowerShell. I find it useful when preparing PowerShell scripts and it should be helpful for people who start exploring PowerShell.
