Bundling and minification improves the speed and rendering performance of any web application. Bundling combines multiple JavaScript or CSS files into a single file where Minification reduces the size of the JavaScript or CSS file by removing white space and commented code without altering functionality. This not only reduces the number of requests to the server, also reduces the size of data transfer from the server to the browser. Both the techniques when used together can help in improving the performance of your web app. Bundling and minification can be done at design time and also at runtime. This post talks about 6 tools for bundling and minification in ASP.NET Core.
