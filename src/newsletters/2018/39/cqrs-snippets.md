The CQRS/CQS pattern works great, I immediately found a lot of benefits. It helps me to enforce separation of concerns, single responsibility and consistency in my codebase, as well as eliminate all that AOP magic with restoring full control over the code execution. Unfortunately, there is also a boring side of implementing CQRS - THE TYPING. I prepared a couple of snippets with Resharperâ€™s LiveTemplates which help to create, consume and test commands and queries to make this tedious part of CQRS more convenient.
