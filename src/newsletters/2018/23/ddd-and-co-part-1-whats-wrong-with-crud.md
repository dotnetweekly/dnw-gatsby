If you put it all together, CRUD's picture is frightening. Since the UPDATE and DELETE actions irreversibly destroy data, historical data cannot be evaluated without additional effort. Furthermore, the artificial limitation to just four verbs makes communication between domain experts and developers very difficult, and hence it fails most of the times.
