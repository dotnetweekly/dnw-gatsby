Together, with a friend of mine Darek (http://foreverframe.net) we’ve spent over half a year (after receiving a lot of great feedback during conferences and changing some initial ideas) on building a free and open source, cloud agnostic solution related to building .NET Core microservices.

The repositories are here:
https://github.com/devmentors

And the main readme you can find here:
https://github.com/devmentors/DNC-DShop

Some additional information can be found here:

Eventually, we’re planning to record a video series how to build your own services based on the source code we implemented.
Here’s the short teaser:
