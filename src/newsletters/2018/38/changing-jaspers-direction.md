I’ve been working off and on for about 4-5 years on a new .Net framework called Jasper (see the “Jasper” tag for my previous posts). Jasper was originally envisioned as a better version of FubuMVC, including both its web framework side and its later functionality as a pretty full fledged service bus that could do publish/subscribe messaging through its own lightweight in process queue (LightningQueues) without any other additional infrastructure.
