Whilst Microsoft’s mobile offering is well and truly dead, their push to provide platform agnostic solutions for developers is alive and well. Xamarin.Forms’ growth has accelerated since Microsoft purchased Xamarin back in 2016 and with .NET Core & .NET Standard providing a simple way to create libraries for all targets easily, C# is becoming a go-to language for creating quality software that scales.

That being said, the ecosystem for mobile app development is also evolving and it’s not hard to get the idea that Xamarin.Forms may not be the go-to solution for mobile app development. Both iOS & Android have beloved languages for native applications in Swift and Kotlin respectively whilst other solutions such as React Native and Flutter achieve what Xamarin.Forms can do without the need for an IDE and heavy toolset. This doesn’t even take into account Progressive Web Applications; an approach to app development in which well crafted, JavaScript driven web applications look and feel like native apps you wouldn’t expect to run in a browser.
