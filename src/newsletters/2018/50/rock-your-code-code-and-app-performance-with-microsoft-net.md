The performance of code is always something that is very important. Even more important if your back-end apps are processing tens of thousands of requests per second. In this session I will reveal the do’s and don’ts when it comes to improving code performance. Some code I will show can be up to 98% faster! Reducing memory that your app uses is also very important and will be discussed in detail. The demos in this session will work with the .NET Framework and .NET Core.
