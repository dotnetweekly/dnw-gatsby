I’ve previously done posts on how to setup both .NET Core 2.1 and .NET Core 2.2. The reason for these posts was because it was still a little shaky exactly which version of the SDK you needed to actually build for these platforms. e.x. If you had .NET Core SDK 2.1, it didn’t actually mean you could build .NET Core 2.1 projects (How infuriating is that?!).

But things have gotten better and now it’s usually just a matter of installing the latest SDK and away you go, so there isn’t really much I could normally write for each version bump. However! .NET Core 3 includes a couple of really important updates that I want to talk about in the future. Windows Forms/WPF development on top of .NET Core, and C# 8. Because of this, I wanted to have a post all written up on setting up your machine for .NET Core 3 development while things are in preview so I don’t have to repeat myself every future post!
