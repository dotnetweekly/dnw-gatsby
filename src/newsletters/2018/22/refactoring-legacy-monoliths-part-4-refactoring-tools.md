As a software developer, it's important to know what tools are available to you. Tedious and repetitive tasks or large "one-off" time-consuming tasks can often be automated by third-party tooling.

To make this blog post more useful than a list of products, I'll go through some high-level steps of a plan that you might also find helpful when tackling a major refactoring expedition on a large project, and highlight some of these tools along the way.
