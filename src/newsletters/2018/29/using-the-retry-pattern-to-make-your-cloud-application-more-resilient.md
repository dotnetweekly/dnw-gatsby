Recently, I was at Boston Code Camp catching up with some old friends and looking to learn about containers or anything that could help me in my current project of migrating a microservices application to run in containers. I was speaking with one friend who had just presented a session on Polly, and he made a comment that got my attention. He said that one of the attendees at his session was under the impression that using the cloud would make his application inherently resilient and he would not need any of the features that Polly provides.
