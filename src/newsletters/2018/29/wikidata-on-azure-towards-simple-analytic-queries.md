In this series of blogposts we are building an ecosystem for hosting a large-scale, multi-domain knowledge base called Wikidata in Azure. In the first leg of the series, we are aiming to run simple analytic queries over Wikidata. First, we transfer the Wikidata dump to Azure, then load it in Azure Data Lake Analytics. By following through with the posts, you will get familiar with a few of the big-data related tools and services of Azure, like Blob Storage, Data Factory, Data Lake Store and Data Lake Analytics.
