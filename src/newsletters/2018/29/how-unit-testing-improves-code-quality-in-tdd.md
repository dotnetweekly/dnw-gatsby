"Tests are stories we tell the next generation of programmers on a project.” — Roy Osherove

And unit tests are the stories which maintain the software quality from the first line of code. Unit tests weed out defects at an early stage, promotes safe refactoring, comprehensive documentation, improved coupling and fewer regression tests.

In software engineering unit tests are never supposed to “replace” any other form of testing, but to be used together the whole time. Unit testing is a continuous learning process. As it is performed by developers, it is important for them to learn how to unit test, what to unit test and the best practices.
