Imagine that,in the not too distant future, you’re the designer of a smart traffic intersection. Your smart intersection has four video cameras connected to an Internet of things (IoT) device with a small CPU, similar to a Raspberry Pi. The cameras send video frames to the IoT device, where they’re analyzed using a machine learning (ML) image-recognition model and control instructions are then sent to the traffic signals. One of the small IoT devices is connected to Azure Cloud Services, where information is logged and analyzed offline.
