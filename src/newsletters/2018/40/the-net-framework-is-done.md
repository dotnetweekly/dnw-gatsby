I fully expect an announcement from Microsoft in the coming months to confirm that Framework v4.8 will be the final release, and that from that point onward, the bulk of the development work will be on Core. Meaning that Core will get all of the new innovations etc moving forward. To be clear, this does NOT mean that framework will go away. It will continue to be supported, and will be as usable, performant, etc as it is now for many many years. There is no need to rush out and do a re-write of existing code. I do however believe that from this point onward Core should be the default choice for new applications.
