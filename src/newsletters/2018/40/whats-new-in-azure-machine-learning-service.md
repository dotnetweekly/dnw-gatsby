Today we are very happy to release the new capabilities for the Azure Machine Learning service. Since our initial public preview launch in September 2017, we have received an incredible amount of valuable and constructive feedback. Over the last 12 months, the team has been very busy enhancing the product, addressing feedbacks, and adding new capabilities. It is extremely exciting to share these new improvements with you. We are confident that they will dramatically boost productivity for data scientists and machine learning practitioners in building and deploying machine learning solutions at cloud scale.
