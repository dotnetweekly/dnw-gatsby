I had presentation for local community about Blazor and as a side-product I built something useful. Blazor supports components that are a little bit similar to ones we have in React.js. I took my previous work from my blog posts Paging with Entity Framework Core and Building Pager view component and built simple but generic pager component for Blazor.
