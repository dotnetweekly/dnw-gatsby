I have seen the future, and it looks a lot like GraphQL. Mark my words: in 5 years, newly minted full-stack app developers wonâ€™t be debating RESTfulness anymore, because REST API design will be obsolete. By the end of this post, I hope you'll see what I see in the promise of GraphQL as a new approach to client-server interaction.
