Roslyn was a huge project that spanned many years. It was a difficult rewrite of the C# and VB compilers into managed code, with the intent of also enabling fast analysis of partial code segments. These days, Roslyn powers many different systems: the compiler itself, the little hints that pop up as you type, and even static analysis systems that you can bundle with your NuGet package to encourage proper usage.
