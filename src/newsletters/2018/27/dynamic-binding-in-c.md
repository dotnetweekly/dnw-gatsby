Type safety is a principle in programming languages which prevents accessing the values in variables inconsistent with their declared type. There are two kinds of type safety based on when the checks are performed:

Static type safety is checked at compile time.
Dynamic type safety is checked at runtime.

Without the checks, the values could be read from the memory as if they were of another type than they are, which would result in undefined behavior and data corruption.
