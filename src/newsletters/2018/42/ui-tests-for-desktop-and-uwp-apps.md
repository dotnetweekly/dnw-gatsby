In this episode, Robert is joined by Timotius Margo, who shows how to create automated UI tests for desktop apps using the WinAppDriver UI Recorder. WinAppDriver is a UI automation service for Windows 10. You can use the UI Recorder to track keyboard and mouse interactions and then view generated C# code. That code provides you with automated UI testing for Windows Forms, WPF and UWP apps.
