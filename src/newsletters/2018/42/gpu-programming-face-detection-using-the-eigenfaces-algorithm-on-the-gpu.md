Computer vision is an area of computer science that involves the identification or labeling of regions in an image. Images are large 2-D arrays of pixels that can be operated upon in parallel. GPUs are ideally suited for accelerating algorithms that entail large amounts of data parallelism, a kind of parallelism in which different portions of a dataset can be operated upon at the same time on multiple processors. Therefore, it should be possible to apply GPUs to the task of implementing efficient computer vision algorithms. In this article Iâ€™ll use the GPU to implement facial detection, a popular problem in computer vision.
