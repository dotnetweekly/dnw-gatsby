C# is one of several languages that target the Microsoft Common Language Runtime (CLR). Languages that target the CLR benefit from features such as cross-language integration and exception handling, enhanced security, a simplified model for component interaction, and debugging and profiling services. Of todayâ€™s CLR languages, C# is the most widely used for complex, professional development projects that target the Windows desktop, mobile, or server environments.
