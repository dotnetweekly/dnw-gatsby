Join Shain Wray from the MSTIC security team as he demonstrates the work of Microsoft's intelligence groups to hunt for and protect against malicious activity in Azure -- and how this leads to the hardening of the controls and defenses available to you. Watch as he helps you to use the detections in Azure to hunt for and to uncover attack vectors that can lead to broader exploits starting with: the OS layer with brute force attacks spanning Windows via Remote Desktop Protocol and Linux-based machines using SSH-based attacks; the app layer; SQL brute force attacks and more.
