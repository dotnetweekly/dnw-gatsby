A huge THANK YOU to all who tuned in live, asked questions, and participated in our twitter feed. We had a lot of awesome sessions from various product teams and community experts that showed us all sorts of cool things we can build with .NET across platforms and devices. Thereâ€™s never been a better time to be a .NET developer! Just getting started with .NET? Head to dot.net.
