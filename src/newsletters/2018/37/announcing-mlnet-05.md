Today, coinciding with the .NET Conf 2018, we’re announcing the release of ML.NET 0.5. It’s been a few months already since we released ML.NET 0.1 at //Build 2018, a cross-platform, open source machine learning framework for .NET developers. While we’re evolving through new preview releases, we are getting great feedback and would like to thank the community for your engagement as we continue to develop ML.NET together in the open.
