In 2011, a Swiss computer scientist named Erich Gamma joined Microsoft. Heâ€™s most known as one of the "gang of four" authors of the influential "Design Patterns" book. At Microsoft, Gamma led a small development lab out of Zurich, Switzerland. In April 2015, the team released the initial version of Visual Studio Code. I encourage you to watch this very interesting Visual Studio Code launch interview with Erich Gamma on Channel 9 (https://channel9.msdn.com/events/Build/2015/C9-05).
