“Jasper” is the codename for a new messaging and command execution framework that my shop has been building out to both integrate with and eventually replace our existing messaging infrastructure as we migrate applications to Netstandard 2.0, ASP.Net Core, and yes, adopt a microservices architecture. While we’ve been working very hard on it over the past 6 months, I’ve been hesitant to talk about it too much online. That ends today with the release of the first usable alpha (0.5.0) to Nuget today.
