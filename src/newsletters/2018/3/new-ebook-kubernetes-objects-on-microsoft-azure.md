Consider this e-book a jumping off point for Kubernetes development projects on Azure. Mahesh Kshirsagar of the Azure Customer Advisory Team (AzureCAT) introduces Kubernetes objects for Azure deployments. This e-book attempts to demystify Kubernetes by focusing on a real-life scenario in which a basic-tiered application is deployed using pods and controllers. Mahesh walks you through the steps to deploy a simple application with a web front end running ASP.NET Core 1.0 and a back end with a SQL Server container running on Linux. Scripts and guidance are available in the accompanying GitHub repository.
