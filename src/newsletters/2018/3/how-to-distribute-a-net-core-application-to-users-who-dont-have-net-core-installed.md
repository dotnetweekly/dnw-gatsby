Case: .NET Core application for a wide user base
Problem: Users don’t have .NET Core installed
Solution: .NET Core self-contained deployments

I have a .NET Core Web Application that developers run locally. The problem is that most of the developers don’t have .NET Core installed on their development machines, so there needs to be a way that all developers can use the application without needing to install .NET Core.
