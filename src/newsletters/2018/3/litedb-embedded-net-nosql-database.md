I was recently in the need for a simple NoSQL database that I could use for an app I was creating for a ASP.NET Core Workshop.

What I was really after was something similar to SQLite.   A single package I could pull into my application that did not require any external service and data stored in a single file.

It didnâ€™t take long to find LiteDB.  After using it for my demo application, I had write a quick post about it.  Just to shed some light for anyone in need.  The project is actually really popular on GitHub, so it seems I might just be late to the party about finding out about it.
