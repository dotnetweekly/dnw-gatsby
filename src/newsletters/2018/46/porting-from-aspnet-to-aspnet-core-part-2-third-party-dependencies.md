This post is part of a series: Part 1: Introduction Part 2: Third party dependencies Part 3: Mechanics of porting Part 4: Deployment and packaging options If you haven’t read the first post yet I suggest reading that first since it introduces the app that I’m porting and some of the reasons behind it. Are my dependencies available on .NET Core? Most software these days consists of not just the code we write, but a lot of third party dependencies as well.
