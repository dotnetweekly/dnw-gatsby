Andrew Lock, the author of the new book ASP.NET Core in Action, has graciously allowed us to repost his recent article about an issue he had with a "missing connection string" error in a new ASP.NET Core application running in Docker. In the article, not only does he cover basic background of environments in ASP.NET Core, he also describes how you would use environment-specific configuration. He describes the bug and provides his solution.
