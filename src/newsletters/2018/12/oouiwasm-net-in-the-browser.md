Iâ€™ve been obsessing over my little .NET web framework Ooui and am excited to announce that it is now capable of running fully in the browser as a web assembly. This means that Xamarin.Forms apps can run completely in the browser - without a smart server - giving .NET developers even more reach and options for distributing their apps. Try the Xamarin.Forms XAML editor demo online or read the getting started guide if you want to try it yourself.
