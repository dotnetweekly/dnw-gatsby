Fake JSON Server is a Back End for prototyping or a template for a CRUD Back End. No need to define types for resources, uses dynamic typing. No need to define routes, routes are handled dynamically. No database, data is stored to a single JSON file. Has authentication, WebSocket notifications, async long running operations, random generation for errors/delays and experimental GraphQL support.
