Double dispatch is a pattern you can use in C# to control how communication flows between two objects. A frequent use of the pattern is to pass “this” to a function on another class, allowing that class to communicate back to or manipulate the calling object instance. It can also be used to achieve polymorphic behavior. I have a GitHub sample you can browse or download that demonstrates some of these techniques.
