This was my primary language, every time I compared it to other popular languages I was happy I accidentally chose it. Python and Javascript lack static typing (assuming JS has any kind of typing), Java lacks proper generics, properties, events, value types, which brings up a mess of all those wrapper classes like Integer and so on.
