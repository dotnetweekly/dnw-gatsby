Yesterday at GitHub Universe, we announced GitHub Actions, a new way to automate and customize your workflows. Configuring the apps and services that make up your development cycle takes significant time and effort. GitHub Actions applies open source principles to workflow automation, weaving together the tools you use from idea to production into one complete workflow. You can also create, share, and discover any actions your projects require, just as you would create, share, and discover code on GitHub.
