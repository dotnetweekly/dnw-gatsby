I recently decided to put serious effort into learning the Rust programming language. I saw it coming up frequently in interesting projects (e.g. ripgrep) and kept hearing good things about it. My hesitation to picking up Rust since its 1.0 release in 2015 came from two fronts. First, I’m completely invested in Go because of InfluxDB. Second, I heard that it was not the easiest thing to learn. While I don’t normally shy away from difficult tasks, I was hesitant because I believe that many developer tools that take off do so because they are easy to use or give developers significant productivity gains. More often than not, I want to invest my time in tools that I think have longevity that will get some critical mass in the market.
