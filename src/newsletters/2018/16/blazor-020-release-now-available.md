Just a few weeks ago we announced the first preview release of an experimental web UI framework called Blazor. Blazor enables full-stack web development using C# and WebAssembly. So far thousands of web developers have taken on the challenge to try out Blazor and done some pretty remarkable things:

- Started using Blazor to build RealWorld web apps
- Used Blazor to control a Christmas tree from a Raspberry Pi
- Built a Blazor app for looking up lyrics to vocaloid music
- Integrated Blazor with the Redux DevTools to do time-traveling debugging
