Do you ever develop prototypes, or starter projects/accelerators, that you’d like to use again in the future? A good way to do that is by creating custom templates for dotnet. Once completed, anytime you want to create a new project of that type in the future, you can key in “dotnet new ” and you’re off, complete with correct namespaces. You can even do conditional checks, or variable replacements.
