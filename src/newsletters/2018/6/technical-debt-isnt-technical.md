Technical debt is not primarily caused by clumsy programming, it is a third-order effect of poor communication. Technical debt is a symptom of an underlying lack of appropriate abstractions, which in turn stems from insufficient modelling of the problem domain. This means that necessary communication has not taken place: discussions and decisions to resolve ambiguity and make informed trade-offs have been swept under the rug. Technical debt is the reification of this lack of resolution in code.
