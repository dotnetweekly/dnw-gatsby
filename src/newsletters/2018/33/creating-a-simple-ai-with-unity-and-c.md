In any given game, artificial intelligence (AI) is often needed to interact with the user, usually as a force against the player. There are some scenarios where the AI is there to help, and others where it’s both fighting and helping you, but at the end of the day there is some resemblance of intelligence controlled by the computer in games. AI can be made to have simple or complex behaviours, depending on a project’s requirements. Such requirements may include needing to conduct diplomacy with another player, or just simply walking back and forth on a platform. Whatever it may be, it’s important to make an AI that does its job well.
