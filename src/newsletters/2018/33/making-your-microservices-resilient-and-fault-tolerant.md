In a Monolith application, a single error has the potential of bringing down the entire application. This can be avoided in a Microservice architecture since it contains smaller independently deployable units, which wont effect the entire system. But does that mean a Microservice architecture is resilient to failures? No, not at all. Converting your monolith into Microservices does not resolve the issues automatically. In fact working with a distributed system has its own challenges!
