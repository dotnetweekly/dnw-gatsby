With the release of ASP.NET Core, there are several templates in the DotNet CLI. One of those templates is an Angular template that scaffolds a single page application built with Angular and ASP.NET Core. The problem with that template is that it scaffolds an Angular 4.2.5 project and Angular released Angular 6 in May of 2018!

In this post, not only will I show you how to build a base CRUD app with ASP.NET Core 2.1 and Angular, but I will show you how to update the Angular project to the latest and greatest, which is Angular 6 as of this writing! Letâ€™s get right to it!
