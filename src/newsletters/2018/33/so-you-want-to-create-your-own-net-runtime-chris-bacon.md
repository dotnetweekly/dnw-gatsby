Running C#/.NET code is something we do all the time. But how does the .exe/.dll file produced by the compiler actually get executed? What's going on inside the dotnet/Mono runtime? How hard could it be to write your own .NET runtime instead? And can it be done in just one hour?
Chris is one of the few people who has written a .NET runtime; albeit inefficient, arguably pointless and now definitely obsolete. In this session we will attempt to code from (almost) nothing to an interpreted .NET runtime that is capable of executing a very simple .NET application; giving some insight into the inner workings of .NET.
