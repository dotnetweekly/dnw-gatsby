Android Emulator version 27.0.2 now includes a feature called Quick Boot, which launches the emulator in just a few seconds. For Quick Boot to work, your AVD must perform a cold boot on its first time booting up. All subsequent starts will use the Quick Boot feature, which restores the system to the state it was last closed in. This feature is turned on by default.
