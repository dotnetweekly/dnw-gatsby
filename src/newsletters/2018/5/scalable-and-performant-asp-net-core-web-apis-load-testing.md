This is another post in a series of articles on creating performant and scalable web APIs using ASP.NET core 2.0. In this post we’ll focus on tools that can help us load test our API to ensure it’s going to perform and scale when it goes into production. Performance and scalability issues are much easier and quicker to resolve before our API has gone into production, so, it’s worth testing our API under simulated demand before it gets there.
