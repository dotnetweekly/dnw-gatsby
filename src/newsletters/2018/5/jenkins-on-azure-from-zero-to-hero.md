We are excited to announce a refresh for the Microsoft Jenkins offer in Azure Marketplace.

Like the previous version, this offer allows customers to run a Jenkins master on a Linux (Ubuntu 16.04 LTS) VM in Azure. The price is the cost of running the software components and Azure infrastructure deployed by the solution template. If you are looking to run Jenkins in the cloud, you will have full control over the Jenkins master you set up.

So why are we so excited about this refresh? Because now you can go from zero to hero. Just set up the server with the configurations you need and start building in the least amount of time.
