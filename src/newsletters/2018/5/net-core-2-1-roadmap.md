The .NET team has been working on the .NET Core 2.1 release for the last several months on GitHub. We know that many of you have been using .NET Core 2.0 since it shipped in August of last year and want to know what is coming next. The team has done enough work now that we know the overall shape of the next release. Like past releases, the .NET community has contributed many important improvements. Thanks so much!
