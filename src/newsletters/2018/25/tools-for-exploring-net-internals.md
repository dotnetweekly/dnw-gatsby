Firstly I’ll start by mentioning that Visual Studio has a great debugger and so does VSCode. Also there are lots of very good (commercial) .NET Profilers and Application Monitoring Tools available that you should also take a look at.

However, the rest of the post is going to look at some more single-use tools that give a even deeper insight into what is going on. As a added bonus they’re all ‘open-source’, so you can take a look at the code and see how they work!!
