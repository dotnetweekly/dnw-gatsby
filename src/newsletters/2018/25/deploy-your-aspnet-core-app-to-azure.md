I've been doing a lot with ASP.NET Core lately on my Linux Work Laptop. One of the drawbacks of using VS Code is there is no easy, right-click publish (Not that I would want to do that anyway). So I thought I'd put together a quick tutorial on setting up an ASP.NET Core app and using Environment variables in Azure to store secrets. https://developer.okta.com/blog/2018/06/19/deploy-your-aspnet-core-app-to-azure
