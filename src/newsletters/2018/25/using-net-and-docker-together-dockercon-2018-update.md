I posted about Using .NET and Docker Together last year. With DockerCon 2018 being this week, it seemed like a great time to give you an update.  Since my last post, we’ve enabled a set of Docker workflows with guidance and samples for .NET Core and .NET Framework, for development, CI/CD, and production. We also offer many more images for both Windows and Linux. If you haven’t taken a look at Docker and .NET recently, now is a good time.

Docker and containers come up more and more in conversations that we have with .NET developers. It has become the way to deploy server applications for many people, due to its primary benefits of consistency and a light-weight alternative to virtual machines. In the DockerCon keynote, there were multiple .NET demos showing how you can use Docker for modern applications and for older applications that use traditional architectures. It has become a lot easier to containerize .NET applications using tools from both Microsoft and Docker.

See Staying up-to-date with .NET Container Images for information about .NET container images.
