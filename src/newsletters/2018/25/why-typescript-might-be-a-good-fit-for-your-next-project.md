JavaScript’s history is somewhat checkered: it started as something we all did to make horrific, GeoCities-style Web sites, and it took a while for the language to shake its script-kiddie reputation as it gained popularity. Today, though, that past is all but forgotten as JavaScript dominates web development. (And JavaScript itself has evolved.)

There are — as TJ VanToll points out in his DevReach talk featured below — 345 languages that will compile to JavaScript through various tools so that people don’t have to actually code in JavaScript. He explains that TypeScript initially seemed like a Very Bad Idea, in the same vein as CoffeeScript or Dart. Why not just stick with JavaScript in the first place? Why something that compiles to JavaScript? Despite VanToll’s admitted early skepticism, TypeScript turned out to be very useful, indeed.
