I enjoy listening to podcasts in a wide range of topics that include but are not limited to politics, software development, history, comedy and true crime. While some of the more entertainment related podcasts are best enjoyed through audio, those that are related to software development or other type of hands-on topics would benefit greatly from having a transcript. Having a transcript allows me to go back after having listened to an interesting discussion and look directly at the content I am interested in without having to listen to the podcast again.
