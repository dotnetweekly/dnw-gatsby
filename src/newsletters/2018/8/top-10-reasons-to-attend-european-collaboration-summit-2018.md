There are many reasons to attend the European Collaboration Summit 2018: it is the largest community-driven conference focusing on Microsoft’s products Office 365, Azure, SharePoint, Exchange, Skype, and Project in Europe in 2018, with an expected attendance of a thousand people. During this three-day event, world-leading experts and speakers will deliver a series of full-day workshops, and a range of “what is new” and “best practices” break-out sessions relevant to these technologies.

Mainz, a picturesque German city with a fascinating history, offers all we need for a great conference: stunning scenery, convenient logistics, a central-European location with easy air links (Frankfurt Airport is close by), and a vibrant Microsoft community.

Here are just some of the reasons why you simply must attend.
