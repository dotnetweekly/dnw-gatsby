Modern applications are increasingly complex systems that involve multiple technology stacks and cloud-native services. Orchestrating an automated release pipeline for these systems can be challenging. Azure Pipelines provides powerful, easy-to-use continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) services you can use to build and test your app and then deploy to your intended targets. In this article, we’ll provide an overview of the key concepts of Azure Pipelines and discuss deployment scenarios for various Azure services. We’ll also walk through a detailed scenario for creating a pipeline for a .NET Core app that targets Docker containers in Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). Finally, we’ll show you the next generation of CI/CD in which your YAML pipeline is configured as part of your code.
