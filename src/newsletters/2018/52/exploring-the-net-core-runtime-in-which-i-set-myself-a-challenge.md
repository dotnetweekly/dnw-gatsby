It seems like this time of year anyone with a blog is doing some sort of ‘advent calendar’, i.e. 24 posts leading up to Christmas. For instance there’s a F# one which inspired a C# one (C# copying from F#, that never happens)

However, that’s a bit of a problem for me, I struggled to write 24 posts in my most productive year, let alone a single month! Also, I mostly blog about ‘.NET Internals’, a subject which doesn’t necessarily lend itself to the more ‘light-hearted’ posts you get in these ‘advent calendar’ blogs.
