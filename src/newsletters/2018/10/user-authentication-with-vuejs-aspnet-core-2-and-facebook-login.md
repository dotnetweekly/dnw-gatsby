In my previous post I detailed how to setup JWT authentication with ASP.NET Core 2, Angular 5, and Facebook OAuth. It received some great feedback and also a few requests to make a Vue.js version - so here it is!

The final product is the same, simple demo we saw in the previous post with a flow to support email registration/login as well as facebook login. Both paths lead to a super-duper secure area of the app only authenticated users can access.
