Many development teams have spent the last few years organizing and empowering cross-functional teams, building independently managed microservices, and implementing DevOps pipelines to go faster than ever!

These industry shifts, critical for organizations to plan less and react more, solved old problems while creating new ones. As we focused on designing domain-aligned microservices, we also engineered JSON-hungry responsive UIs, Single Page Apps, and portals to consume them. A ton of client-side code has been thrown into our frontend layers creating monoliths, which are often maintained by a different team. Front ends have become increasingly more complex, interdependent and highly coupled to whatever Angular-React-Ember-Vue framework was cool when it was built.
