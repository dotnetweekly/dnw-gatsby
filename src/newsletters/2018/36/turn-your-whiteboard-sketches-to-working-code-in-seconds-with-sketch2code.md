User interface design process involves a lot a creativity that starts on a whiteboard where designers share ideas. Once a design is drawn, it is usually captured within a photograph and manually translated into some working HTML wireframe to play within a web browser. This takes efforts and delays the design process. What if a design is refactored on the whiteboard and the browser reflects changes instantly? In that sense, by the end of the session there is a resulting prototype validated between the designer, developer, and customer. Introducing Sketch2Code, a web based solution that uses AI to transform a handwritten user interface design from a picture to a valid HTML markup code.
