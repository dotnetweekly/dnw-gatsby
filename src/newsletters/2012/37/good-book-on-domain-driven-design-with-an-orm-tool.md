If you are thinking of using an ORM you will probably considering Domain Driven Design as a possible approach. The <a href="http://books.google.gr/books/about/Domain_Driven_Design.html?id=hHBf4YxMnWMC&amp;redir_esc=y">book by Evans </a>Â has all the theory behind DDD. But Nilsson went one step further. He read Evans book and then applied it in a C# project using nHibernate as his ORM. This book is a very good introduction to practicing "Domain Driven Design" in C#.
