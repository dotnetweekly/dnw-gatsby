If you enjoy developing with <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/" target="_blank">Knockout.js</a>, then you’ll be glad to hear that support has been added for Knockout Intellisense in Visual Studio 2012! These features are pretty cool and will save me and other developers from senseless typos. Developers who are newer to Knockout.js will enjoy the intellisense as an easy way to quickly learn the available built in bindings.
