Easy Asynchrony with C#: No More Callbacks! The Windows Runtime and .NET Framework 4.5 rely heavily on an asynchronous programming model to ensure the responsiveness of client apps and scalability of services. The new async feature in the C# and VB languagesmakes it easy to coordinate asynchronous functionality without callbacks, leaving the plumbing to the compilers. Weâ€™ll explore a simple sequential asynchronous Windows Store app, and build up to easily embrace cancellation, coordination of concurrent asynchronous activities and offloading of CPU-intensive work through the Task Parallel Library.
