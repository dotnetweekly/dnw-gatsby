A small book that will teach you everything you need to know on REST services. This book, is theoretical but not to the extent that it will bore you. It just summarizes the minimum knowledge you need in order to build really RESTful services. This book is the "additional" thing forÂ you to build functional and high quality REST services with the ASP.NET MVC4 WebAPI.
