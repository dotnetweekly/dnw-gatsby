This book is small but contains the information of a book double its size. If you are new to EF and want to learn about the ORM goodies of DBContext then this is the book to read. If you are an Entity Framework guy (guru) used to work with ObjectContext and wondering what code-first and the DbContext have to offer this is the quickest way to find out!
