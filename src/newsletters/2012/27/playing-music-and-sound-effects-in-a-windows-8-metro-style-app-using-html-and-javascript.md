I have recently been coding a Windows 8 Metro Style App using the new Windows 8 Release Preview bits and Visual Studio Express 2012 RC.  The app is going to be a retro shooter that takes advantage of HTML5 Canvas for the main game engine and then several Windows 8 Metro Style App Features. 

What game would rock without Music and Sound Effects!  So how do we add that functionality to a Metro Style App?  For my game I decided to take two routes.
