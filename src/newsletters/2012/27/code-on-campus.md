Don’t delay - you can save $300 if you register before July 10th.  Join us and your peers for 5 days on Microsoft Campus, and you'll leave with an intense .NET education on the Microsoft Development Platform.

The Microsoft Development Platform is reaching a huge milestone. With Windows 8 waiting in the wings, critical praise and Nokia’s support for Windows Phone, the industry-wide HTML5 push, Big Data and continual emphasis on Cloud Computing, just about everything is changing and growing.
