In the previous post, I wrote about how you can use the existing providers for Google, Facebook etc. and retrieve extra metadata about the authenticated users. Letâ€™s assume you wanted to change the way the providers request for information. Some examples of this could be

You want to request more data about the user
You want to apply different scope levels when requesting the data
This post covers how you can write your own provider and plug it into your ASP.NET web application
