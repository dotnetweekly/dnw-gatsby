So you're a .Net Gadgeteer builder. Your project is coming together and now you want to build a case, cover, fitting or something. To build it just right you need the given hardware pieces, the buttons, boards, etc, so you can measure and fit it. But you don't want to use the actual hardware for that (since it's already assembled and all that)... What you need is something that is just like the hardware, same size and all, a real life model of the hardware pieces. Maybe even something you could 3D print yourself?
