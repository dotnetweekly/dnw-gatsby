Are you looking for a HTML5/CSS authoring tool on Windows 8? Blend is the tool.

Blend helps simplify design tasks by providing an accurate design surface and powerful tools that let you visually create and edit HTML and CSS. It gives you great tools to create, edit and diagnose CSS, supporting some of the latest CSS standards, including CSS Grid, Gradients, Transitions, and media queries. It also is designed to handle app UX that makes heavy use of JavaScript to dynamically create and manipulate DOM elements. Using Interactive Mode you can even interact with the app on the design surface and bring it into states that are not reachable via markup at all.
