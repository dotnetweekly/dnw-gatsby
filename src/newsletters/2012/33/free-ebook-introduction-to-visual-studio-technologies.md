The new Visual Studio is a rich and complex integrated development environment. It supports a range of languages and an even larger range of project types. In this chapter, I will give you a high-level overview of the most important parts of Visual Studio. I start with showing you how to create a project before going on to introduce the code editor, the visual design surface and the all-important build and debugging tools.
I only have space to cover the essentials, so at the end of each section I have listed three features which I suggest you explore further. These are the features that I find useful and which showcase the rich functionality and flexibility that Visual Studio offers.
