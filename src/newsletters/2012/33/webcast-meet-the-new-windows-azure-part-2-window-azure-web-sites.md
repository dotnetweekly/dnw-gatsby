Did you know there is a new streamlined way to do web sites in the Microsoft cloud? Microsoft has released an all-new Windows Azure and it’s time to get reacquainted. Neudesic MVPs will show you Windows Azure Web Sites, a new mode of using the Microsoft cloud for 2-tier web sites. You’ll see how you can create new web sites in the cloud in under a minute, with great support for common open source frameworks such as Drupal, Joomla, Orchard, Umbraco, and WordPress.  You’ll also learn about the new My SQL database support.
