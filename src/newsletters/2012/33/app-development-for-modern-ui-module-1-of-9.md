In this module, students learn about core concepts of HTML5 and CSS3 as used in Metro apps, including layout models, styles, and animations. Specifically, they examine page layout using regions, grid layout, flexible box layout, multiple columns, text-wrap, and media queries. They also explore 2D & 3D transforms, transitions, animations, gradients, box and text shadow, border-radius, inline SVG and canvas.
