There are several conferences, talks, and seminars that take place throughout the year. Since not everyone has the opportunity to attend these, we're providing a roll-up of recent events so you can find the most informative presentations easily. Check out some of our favorites from TechEd North America 2012, TechEd Europe 2012, and aspConf.
