I’ve been quiet the past few months. Really ever since Imagine Cup, I’ve been head down, planning, scheming, organizing and generally hiding away while I got ready. Ready for what? Ready for this: WOWZAPP 2012 – the world’s first worldwide hackathon for Windows!

WOWZAPP 2012 will run in dozens of countries around the globe – all on the one weekend – November 9-11 – allowing developers and designers the world over to come together with one goal – to have fun, network and learn and to build apps and games for Windows.
