One key question some Windows Phone developers struggle with when putting an app on sale is: how much should I charge?

The Windows Phone Dev Center gives developers more control over pricing because Dev Center now lets developers set a unique price (from available price tiers) for every country or region where paid apps can be sold. This capability, not found in all major app stores, provides an exciting new way to fine-tune your sales strategy. Furthermore, market-specific pricing applies not only to apps and games, but also to in-app items offered through apps built for Windows Phone 8.
