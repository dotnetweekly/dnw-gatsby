Absolutely!

I had a question from a friend a few months ago about the Windows 8 Modern UI replacing WPF and if he should still invest in training for desktop development. I understand where the concern is coming from – WinRT is the new shiny kid on the block and there is a fear of irrelevancy. Stave off your fear, my friends! Desktop is here to stay for the foreseeable future and polishing up the ole WPF skills is never a bad thing. There will be demand for that skillset for years to come as companies still have to build robust desktop apps that just don’t fit into the Modern UI scenario.
