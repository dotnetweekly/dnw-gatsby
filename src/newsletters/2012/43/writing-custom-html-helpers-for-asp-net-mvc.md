<p>As a web forms developer, I found the transition to MVC to be a bit of a shock at first. Without fully understanding the nature of MVC, I found the lack of a Toolbox filled with server controls to be confusing. However, once it became clear that the goal of MVC was to expose HTML markup and give developers full control over what is rendered to the browser, I quickly embraced the idea.</p>
