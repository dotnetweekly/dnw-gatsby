I’ve been working with Visual Studio 2012 since the RC, and I’ve come to the realization that I’m sold. With any new piece of software (especially an upgrade), the importance of first impressions cannot really be overstated. With VS 2012, well, I had some issues with the UI. It was grey. The menus were in ALL CAPS. Since it was the RC, I ran into a few bugs. All of this left a bad taste in my mouth, and I thought I wasn’t a fan. But I stuck with it, never realizing just how much I was beginning to love it
