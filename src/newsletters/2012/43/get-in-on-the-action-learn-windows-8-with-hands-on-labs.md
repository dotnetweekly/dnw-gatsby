By now, hopefully youâ€™ve had a chance to get your Windows Store Developer Account up and running. If not, get on it! Remember, if you have an MSDN subscription, a DreamSpark account (for students registered in select, accredited, post-secondary educational institutions) or BizSpark, you can activate a free 1 year membership. See my post from last week on how to make the registration process quick and painless.
