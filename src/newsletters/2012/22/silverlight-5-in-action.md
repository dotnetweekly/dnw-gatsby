Microsoft's Silverlight is the only development platform that combines the performance, security, and flexibility of a desktop application with cross-platform deployment. The latest version, Silverlight 5, offers tons of new features including improved video, audio, and text rendering, enhanced MVVM support, XNA-based 3D and sound APIs, and under-the-hood performance upgrades.
