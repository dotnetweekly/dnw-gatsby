Some of my teammates and I have created a series of one-hour talks on developing Metro apps for Windows 8.  Recordings of this MSDN series are available using the links below.  Don’t forget to download the<a href="http://bit.ly/jenwin8rp" target="_blank">Windows 8 Release Preview</a> and <a href="http://bit.ly/jenvs2012" target="_blank">Visual Studio 2012 RC</a> so you can code along with us.  Enjoy!
