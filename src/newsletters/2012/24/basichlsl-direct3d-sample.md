The samples in this section show how to use Microsoft Direct3D in a C# managed code application. When you have mastered the tutorials, you are ready to jump into the samples. Some of these samples demonstrate the latest features of Microsoft DirectX 9.0 for Managed Code. Other samples demonstrate existing functionality that is fundamental to using Direct3D. All of the samples are built on top of the sample framework. See The Sample Framework and Sample Framework Reference.
