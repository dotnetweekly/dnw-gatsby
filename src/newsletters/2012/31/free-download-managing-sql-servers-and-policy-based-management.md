Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio is the primary tool you use to manage databases and servers. Other tools available to manage local and remote servers include SQL Server PowerShell, SQL Server Configuration Manager, Database Engine Tuning Advisor, and SQL Server Profiler. You use SQL Server Configuration Manager to manage SQL Server services, networking, and client configurations. Database Engine Tuning Advisor is available to help optimize indexes, indexed views, and partitions, and SQL Server Profiler lets you examine events generated by SQL Server, which can provide helpful details for troubleshooting. In this chapter, you will learn how to use SQL Server Management Studio.
