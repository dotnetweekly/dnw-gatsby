IndexedDB is a database that can be used "client-side" with JavaScript code. It is also supported by Windows 8 store apps. Since it is a work in progress there is a lot of inconsistent information on the web. It is good idea to get a general view on how it works by browsing the official documentation for the API (you can also play with it <a href="http://html5labs.interoperabilitybridges.com/IndexedDBTest/CodeSnippets/samples.html">here</a>Â or read a gentle introduction be Stephen Walther <a href="http://stephenwalther.com/archive/2012/05/24/metro-walkthrough-creating-a-task-list-with-a-listview-and-indexeddb.aspx">here</a>).
