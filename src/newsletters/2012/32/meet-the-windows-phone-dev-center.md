Today Iâ€™m happy to announce the debut of the Windows Phone Dev Center, the new online home for Windows Phone developers.

The site, an evolution of our retired App Hub developer portal, is designed to provide everything you need to build, publish, and manage apps for Windows Phones around the world. The result of months of careful planning and attention to your feedback, it has new features to help make Windows Phone app development faster and more profitable.
