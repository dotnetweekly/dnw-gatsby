Hello! To help celebrate the Windows 8 Release Preview and the Visual Studio 2012 Release Candidate, weâ€™re happy to release a preview edition of Programming Windows 8 Apps with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, by Kraig Brockschmidt (who, some of you might remember, many years ago worked with us on a couple editions of Inside OLE).
