There's lots of goodness happening in the .NET and ASP.NET community right now. If you're not plugged in, you can follow ASP.NET on Twitter or Like ASP.NET on Facebook and we'll keep you up to date with all the great goings-in. You can visit, bookmark and subscribe to the newly revamped and oft-updated ASP.NET website. The new site is lovely on various phones and pads and has loads of content, both textual and video as well as HOURS of free training videos from Pluralsight. There's also an excellent Daily Community Spotlight on the home page there you can also subscribe to in Google Reader that is curated by our very own Jon Galloway.
