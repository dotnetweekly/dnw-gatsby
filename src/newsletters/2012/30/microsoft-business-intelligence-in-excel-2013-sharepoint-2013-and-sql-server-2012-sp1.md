Last week, Excel 2013 Preview, SharePoint 2013 Preview and SQL Server 2012 Service Pack 1 Community Technology Preview 3 (SP1 CTP3) became available for customers to download. This release comes on the heels of SQL Server 2012, released just a few months ago, which delivered a major set of Business Intelligence capabilities for all users with Power View, as a leading new end user visualization tool. The SQL Server 2012 release enables end users to unlock new insights with data discovery across their organization while providing IT the necessary visibility and oversight to deliver credible, consistent data.
