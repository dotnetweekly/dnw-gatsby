Many years ago, when I was just starting out with .NET (in the 1.0 days - now nearly 10 years ago), <a href="http://www.west-wind.com/presentations/configurationclass/configurationclass.asp" target="_blank">I wrote an article about an Application Configuration</a> component I created to improve application configuration using strongly typed classes. To me, application configuration is something that I've been adamant about since - well forever, even pre-dating .NET. An easy to access configuration store along with an easy application access mechanism to access and maintain configuration settings through code are crucial to building applications that are adaptable. I found that the default configuration features built into .NET are pretty good, but they still take a bit of effort to maintain and manage.
