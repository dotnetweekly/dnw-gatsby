It’s time for a current, definitive JavaScript book, and in this comprehensive beginner’s guide, bestselling author Larry Ullman teaches the language as it is implemented today. Larry demonstrates how to build upon JavaScript’s ease of use, while demystifying its often-cryptic syntax, especially for those who have not programmed before. This book enforces modern JavaScript’s best practices and embraces key Web development approaches such as progressive enhancement and unobtrusive scripting. The author demonstrates loads of real-world code and makes it available for download.
