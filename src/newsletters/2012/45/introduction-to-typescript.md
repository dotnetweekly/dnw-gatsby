enjoy developing software in a multitude of languages although I will freely admit that I’m not a huge fan of JavaScript (or should I say ECMAScript?) by any stretch of theimagination. <em>However</em>, if you’re more familiar with that language than say, C#, VB.NET, etc. you now have the ability to create some very powerful and visually stunning Windows 8 applications (i.e. HTML5 + JavaScript). Of course wouldn’t it be great to have some of the functionality that we as developers have come to use/need over the years like static typing, classes, modules, etc. in JavaScript? Enter <a href="http://www.typescriptlang.org/" target="_blank">TypeScript</a>.
