Along with the release of Windows Phone 8, the Windows Phone 8 SDK is now available for free download. You can get it from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35471">here</a>. With this you can create applications for the new Windows 8 devices and use lots of yummy new features. And they are yummy. I’m using a couple of them in a “groundbreaking new application” that I’m working on in top secret. It’s so secret that I’m only allowing myself to see every other character of the code. And no, the groundbreaking part is not that you can use it as a shovel.
