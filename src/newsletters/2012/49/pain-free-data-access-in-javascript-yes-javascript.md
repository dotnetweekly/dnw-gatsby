Although I think of myself as a plumber when it comes to software development, I have to do a fair amount of client-side development as well. Even in this column, I venture into client apps where they intersect with data access. But when the client side is JavaScript, it’s never been pretty—my JavaScript skills, unfortunately, are still lacking and each learning curve is a world of pain for me (and for my Twitter followers, who are subjected to my venting). But it’s always worth it when I push through the brick wall and get to success.
