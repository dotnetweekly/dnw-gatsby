Years ago I thought it would be a good idea to learn how to play golf. Before I signed up for lessons at my local driving range, I had never picked up a golf club. At my first lesson, the instructor asked me if I had ever had lessons before or ever tried to play golf. When I told him no, he said, “Good! We won’t have any old habits to get out of your swing.”
