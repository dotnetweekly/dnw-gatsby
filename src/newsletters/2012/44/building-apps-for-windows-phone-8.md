It’s a very exciting time for developers!  Last week, we launched <a href="http://windows8.com/">Windows 8</a> and <a href="http://surface.com/">Surface</a>. On Monday, we launched<a href="http://windowsphone.com/">Windows Phone 8</a> and introduced some awesome new smartphone <a href="http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/phones">devices</a>. Today, we’re kicking off the <a href="http://www.buildwindows.com/">Build</a> conference, where we’ll join with thousands of developers in person, and with hundreds of thousands virtually, to explore the opportunities available with Microsoft platforms and tools.  And now, in conjunction with yesterday’s Windows Phone 8 news and with our goal of having tools available on the same cadence as the platforms, I’m very excited to share that the<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35471">Windows Phone SDK 8.0</a>, including Visual Studio Express 2012 for Windows Phone, is <a href="http://blogs.windows.com/windows_phone/b/wpdev/archive/2012/10/30/announcing-the-new-windows-phone-8-developer-platform.aspx">now available</a> for download.
