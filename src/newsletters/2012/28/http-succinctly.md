HTTP is the foundational protocol for exchanging information across the World Wide Web. With HTTP Succinctly, you’ll learn all about something you use on a daily basis, perhaps without realizing what goes on behind the scenes. You’ll quickly learn about resources, requests and responses, safe and unsafe methods, connections, cookies, security, and so much more. Equipped with the information in this book, you’ll be able to write better web apps and services, and debug them when something goes wrong.
