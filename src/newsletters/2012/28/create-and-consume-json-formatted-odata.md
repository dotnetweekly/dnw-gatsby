In my June column, “Data Bind OData in Web Apps with Knockout.js” (msdn.microsoft.com/magazine/jj133816), I had some fun with Knockout.js and OData. As I learned how to data bind Knockout to the results of the OData service, I also found out more about OData and JSON than I had previously known. In this month’s column, I’ll shift my focus to consuming JSON from OData and creating JSON-friendly WCF Data Services.
