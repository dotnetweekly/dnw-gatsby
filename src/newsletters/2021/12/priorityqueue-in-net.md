It’s somewhat surprising in the 20 years .NET has been out, there hasn’t been an official implementation of a Priority Queue. It hasn’t stopped people hacking together their own Priority Queues, and indeed, even Microsoft has had several implementations of priority queues buried internally in the framework, but just never exposed for the public. Finally, Microsoft has come to the party and implemented an official Priority queue in .NET 6. Yes, .NET 6.
