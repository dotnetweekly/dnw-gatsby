Containers, Docker, Kubernetes, and Serverless are often used when explaining a Microservices architecture. However, focusing on physical deployment is missing the point of Microservices entirely. Microservices (or any size services) are about logical separation and not about physical deployment. Deployment flexibility is a by-product of having well-defined boundaries for services that are autonomous.
