This is a companion article to the EF Core Community Standup called “Performance tuning an EF Core app” where I apply a series of performance enhancements to a demo ASP.NET Core e-commerce book selling site called the Book App. I start with 700 books, then 100,000 books and finally ½ million books.

This article, plus the EF Core Community Standup video, pulls information from chapters 14 to 16 from my book “Entity Framework Core in Action, 2nd edition” and uses code in the associated GitHub repo https://github.com/JonPSmith/EfCoreinAction-SecondEdition.
