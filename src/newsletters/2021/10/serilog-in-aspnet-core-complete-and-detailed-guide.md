This article will cover what is Serilog along with its concepts and how to implement Serilog in ASP.NET Core. ASP.NET Core has a built-in logging API that supports a wide variety of logging providers. Serilog is one of the most popular logging frameworks which can be plugged-in into .NET Core based applications.

Logging providers works by storing logs in some destination like file or database. In-built logging API is available in Microsoft.Extensions.Logging namespace and works mostly all in-built and third-party logging providers.

Serilog provides libraries for logging application information into the console, files, etc. Serilog supports structured logging which is a very popular format when it comes to reading these log information using some tool.
