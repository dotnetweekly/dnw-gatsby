It is quite a possible situation to have a user navigating to the client applicationâ€™s page that sends an HTTP request to the server. While our app processing the request, a user can navigate away from that page. In such a case, we want to cancel the HTTP request since the response is no longer important to that user.

So, in this article, we are going to learn how to use CancellationToken to cancel HTTP requests in our client application.
