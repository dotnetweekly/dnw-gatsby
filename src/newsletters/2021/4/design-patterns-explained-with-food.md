GOF Design Patterns in C# with working examples inspired by food

This repository was made as a way to demonstrate and learn using moderately realistic examples of the Gang of Four Design Patterns (Design Patterns - Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software) by Gamma, Helm, Johnson, and Vlissides.

A YouTube series is in progress covering the details of each project. It starts here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_6uQwBjsmk
