Open Telemetry is an open source specification, tools and SDK's used to instrument, generate, collect, and export telemetry data (metrics, logs, and traces). Open Telemetry is backed by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) which backs a mind boggling array of popular open source projects. It's worth looking at the CNCF Landscape to see what I really mean. The SDK's support all the major programming languages including C# and ASP.NET Core.
