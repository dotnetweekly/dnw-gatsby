With .NET 6 Preview 3 we are shipping the latest progress for mobile and desktop development with .NET Multi-platform App UI. This release adds the Windows platform with WinUI 3, improves the base application and startup builder, adds native lifecycle events, and continues to add more UI controls and layout capabilities. We are also introducing new semantic properties for accessibility. As we explore each of these in a bit more detail, we invite you to dotnet new along with us and share your feedback.
