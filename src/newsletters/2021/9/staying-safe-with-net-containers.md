Container-based application deployment and execution has become very common. Nearly all cloud and server app developers we talk to use containers in some way. We mostly hear about public cloud use, but also IoT and have even heard of .NET containers pulled and used over satellite links on cruise ships. In the early days, we would share compelling reasons why people should consider containers. We no longer do that because containers are so widely used now. We are focused on making .NET a great container platform, and adapting as the container ecosystem evolves.
