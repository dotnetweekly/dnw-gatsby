In our last post, we announced that you can create .NET Notebooks in Visual Studio Code. Today we are announcing that .NET Interactive now ships with T-SQL support in addition to C#, F#, PowerShell, JavaScript, and HTML.

The .NET Interactive team has collaborated with the Azure Data Studio team to bring SQL integration to .NET Notebooks. SQL notebooks combine the benefits of querying data with the rich visualization of notebooks.
