It’s no secret that I’m a fan of Azure Static Web Apps and I’m constantly looking for ways to make it easier for people to get working with it.

Something I hadn’t done much with until recently was work with the Authentication and Authorization aspect of it; I knew it was there, but I wasn’t building anything that required it.

While building a video chat app on Twitch I found myself jumping back and forth to the documentation to make sure that I was creating the login URLs correctly, loading the profiles, etc. and so it’s time to do something about it.
