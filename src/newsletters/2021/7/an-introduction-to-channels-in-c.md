Channels give us a way to communicate between concurrent (async) operations in .NET. Channel<T> was included in .NET Core 3.0 (so it's been available for a bit over a year now). I first encountered channels in Go (golang) several years ago, so I was really interested when I found out that they are available to use in C#.
