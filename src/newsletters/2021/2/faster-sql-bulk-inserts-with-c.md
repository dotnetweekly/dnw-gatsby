Over the past year, I've had to migrate multiple legacy applications to a new application. These new applications had their own database structure, so we needed to migrate the data from the legacy application to the new application. With each migration, the quality of the code improved because of the experiences from the past migrations, and my overall knowledge. Not only did the code quality improve, but there was also a very noticeable speed difference (in a good way) although the amount of data increased.
