In this event, we are going to take a look at web development with Blazor (both Blazor Web Assembly and Blazor Server), now that that new technology has been available for a while. We will take an in-depth look at what's new in Blazor for .NET 5. Attendees will come away with a solid understanding of what Blazor is and how it can be used as part of your modern development mix.
