I'm not ashamed to admit that for a long time I avoided writing tests for my code. I saw it as something that took up precious time that I could have spent on "real" coding. However, after experiencing first-hand the headache caused from having to maintain production code with little-to-no tests, I've been convinced that writing tests really are worth your time. Too many times have I been bitten by hidden bugs, that could have easily been identified if the appropriate tests were in place.
