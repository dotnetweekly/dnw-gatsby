Start with a Monolith! Why? Finding boundaries is a difficult thing to do and even harder to get right. Having to define those boundaries up-front for a microservices architecture is a recipe for additional and unneeded complexity. If you develop a loosely Coupled Monolith by applying the same principles when developing Microservices, youâ€™ll be in a better place to refactor and change your boundaries as you gain insights.
