This Infinite scroll function not there in default Xamarin Forms, so we need to add the plugin for this. Here, we need to know, how infinite scroll works, First, we are going to show fixed no of data. Once the user scrolls to reach in the end, we can add more data at the end of the list, so that list will continuously scroll until the data end. Examples, Facebook Feed, and Twitter Feed.
