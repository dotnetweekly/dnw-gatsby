Facebook today released the Facebook SDK for .NET, to enable Windows-focused developers to integrate their applications with Facebook.

The SDK was announced on the Windows Phone Developer <a href="http://blogs.windows.com/windows_phone/b/wpdev/archive/2013/04/18/facebook-sdk-for-net-featured-in-the-facebook-technology-partner-program.aspx" target="_blank">Blog</a>. The open-source SDK is C#/XAML based, and can be found at the Outercurve <a href="http://facebooksdk.net/" target="_blank">Web site</a>. Most developers will want to install the SDK using <a href="https://github.com/facebook-csharp-sdk/facebook-csharp-sdk" target="_blank">NuGet</a> (<a href="http://facebooksdk.net/docs/web/getting-started" target="_blank">this page</a> recommends having the latest version of NuGet; some features of the SDK won't work with older versions.)
