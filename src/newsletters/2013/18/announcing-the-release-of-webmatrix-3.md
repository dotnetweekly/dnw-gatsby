I’m excited to announce the release of WebMatrix 3.  WebMatrix is a free, lightweight web development tool we first <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2010/07/06/introducing-webmatrix.aspx">introduced in 2010</a>, and which provides a great, focused web development experience for ASP.NET, PHP, and Node.js.
