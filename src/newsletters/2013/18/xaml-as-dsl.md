<div>The idea of a Domain Specific Language (DSL) is not new. Probably the most well known DSL is SQL – a language for working with databases. A DSL is typically constrained to a specific domain or a specific task (hence the name). A DSL may be a completely new language (such as SQL), and this is termed “external DSL”, and it can be constructed using a specific language semantics, such as C#, by leveraging certain language features that make up the “new” language. in C#, extension methods and “fluent interfaces” are most often used for that task.</div>
