When developing web sites, we should all be thinking “touch friendly”.

Now that I have a Surface RT tablet, I realize how bad so many websites are for touch devices like a tablet. Lucky for me my Surface has a keyboard with a track pad built into the cover. Because on numerous occasions I find myself stuck on a website and I need to switch to “keyboard” mode and use the track pad/pointer to be able to use some drop down menu type of input.  Obviously this didn’t matter for many years an there are a lot of old sites living across the internet. Over the years, I was just I was just as guilty of this bad programming technique as the next developer, we just didn’t need to worry about touch. But those days are over and I’m ready to make a change.
