At Velocity 2011, <a href="http://stubbornella.org/">Nicole Sullivan</a> and I introduced <a href="http://csslint.net/">CSS Lint</a>, the first code-quality tool for CSS. We had spent the previous two weeks coding like crazy, trying to create an application that was both useful for end users and easy to modify. Neither of us had any experience launching an open-source project like this, and we learned a lot through the process.
