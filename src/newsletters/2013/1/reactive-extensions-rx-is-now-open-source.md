A few years back <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/HanselminutesPodcast198ReactiveExtensionsForNETRxWithErikMeijer.aspx">I did a podcast with Erik Meijer</a> about Reactive Extensions for .NET (Rx). Since then thousands of people have enjoyed using Rx in the projects and a number of open source projects like <a href="http://www.reactiveui.net/">ReactiveUI</a> (also <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/HanselminutesPodcast252ReactiveUIExtensionsToTheReactiveFrameworkRxWithPaulBetts.aspx">on the podcast</a>) have popped up around it. Even <a href="https://github.com/blog/1127-github-for-windows">GitHub for Windows uses Reactive Extensions</a>. In fact, GitHub uses Rx a LOT in their Windows product. My friend Paul at GitHub says they liked the model so much they made a Mac version!
