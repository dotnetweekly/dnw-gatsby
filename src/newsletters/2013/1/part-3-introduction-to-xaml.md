Now that we have a project, it's time to learn XAML for user interface layout and interaction.  Bob provides a fast but gentle introduction -- as he calls it, the "cheater's guide" -- to learning this declarative language.  He explains what XAML is at a high level and its justification.  He provides hands-on, practical examples of XAML layout controls, attached properties, navigating between the XAML and code-behind files / partial classes and how the XAML and C# is compiled into intermediate language.
