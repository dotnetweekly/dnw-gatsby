Buddy is a Backend as a Service (BaaS) platform designed to do two things. First, it's designed to free mobile app developers from needing to build a backend service for their mobile app. Most mobile apps do a set of standard things: they create and manage users, save photos, create contact connections between users, and send push notifications, for example.Â  We designed the Buddy platform to replace the work of building those back-end tasks, with just a few easy API calls. Using Buddy, you can focus on writing great mobile apps and not on managing servers.
