We are continuing our journey to deliver a final release of Update 2.  You can read about the CTP3 we shipped a few weeks ago <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/bharry/archive/2013/02/11/ctp-for-visual-studio-2012-update-2-vs-2012-2-is-available.aspx">here</a>.  The most notable thing about this CTP is that it is “go-live”.  One of our big learnings from shipping Update 1 was that we really do need feedback from real customer deployments before we ship a major update.  We provided a “go-live” build to a select set of early adopters in the last CTP and got some great feedback.  In that process we found 3 or 4 significant bugs and fixed them for this CTP.  We now need a bunch more people to give it a go and report any issues they find.  If all goes well, we hope to release Update 2 soon.
