As I’ve written about <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/somasegar/archive/2012/11/12/building-apps-for-office-and-sharepoint.aspx">previously</a>, we’ve been <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/somasegar/archive/2012/07/17/office-development-with-visual-studio-2012-and-napa.aspx">developing tools</a> for building the next-generation of <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/apps/fp160950.aspx">apps for Office and SharePoint</a>.  These tools manifest both as an online experience known as “Napa”, which we’ve been updating on a weekly basis, as well as a complete set of extensions to the rich Visual Studio client, extensions we’ve shared several times in preview form. Hot on the heels of last week’s announcement of commercial availability of the new Microsoft Office 365, I’m excited to announce that today we’re releasing those rich client tools, the Microsoft Office Developer Tools for Visual Studio 2012.  You can download them now from <a href="http://aka.ms/OfficeDevToolsForVS2012">http://aka.ms/OfficeDevToolsForVS2012</a>.
