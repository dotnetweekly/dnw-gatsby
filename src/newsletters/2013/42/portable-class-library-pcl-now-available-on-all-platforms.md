You can build .NET apps across a wide variety of platforms, and the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/gg597391.aspx">Portable Class Library (PCL)</a> helps you share your code and libraries across .NET platforms.  Specifically, the PCL provides a set of common reference assemblies that enable .NET libraries and binaries to be used on any .NET based runtime – from phones, to clients, to servers and clouds.
