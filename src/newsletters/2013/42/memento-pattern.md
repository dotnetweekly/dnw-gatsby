he memento design pattern is a pattern that helps to save the object internal state in an external place enabling us to restore the state later when needed. The memento pattern doesn’t violate encapsulation of the internal state. The pattern is rarely used but it’s very helpful in scientific computing or in computer games (saving of check points in the game for example).
