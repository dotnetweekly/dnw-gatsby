Those following the Visual Studio 2013 launch may have noticed that we've taken your UserVoice feedback seriously and brought more Productivity Power Tools into the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/visualstudio/archive/2013/07/15/visual-studio-2013-new-editor-features.aspx">core Visual Studio experience</a>. We selected the all-time favorites: Enhanced Scrollbar, Move-line and Brace Completion; polished and improved them for prime-time. Once we wrapped up work on Power Tools 2013, we started discussing what we'd like to deliver in the next round of Productivity Power Tools.
