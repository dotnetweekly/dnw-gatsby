Code Snippets in VS are basically XML files that sit in a special location (one of two locations, global or user).  These code snippets can apply to many things including languages (C#, VB, etc.) as well as ‘markup’ languages (CSS and now XAML).  You can read more in-depth data about <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms165392(v=vs.120).aspx">VS Code Snippets here</a>. The basics that I think you want to know are the two main types of snippets: Expansion and SurroundWith.
