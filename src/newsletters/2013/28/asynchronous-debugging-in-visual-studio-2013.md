In this episode, Robert is joined by Brad Sullivan, who shows us asynchronous debugging in Visual Studio 2013. This enhances your debugging experience in both .NET and Windows Store apps. Previously, it could be very difficult for a developer stopped at a breakpoint to know the asynchronous sequence of calls that brought them to the current location.Â  Now in Visual Studio 2013, the Call Stack window surfaces this information, factoring in new diagnostics information provided by the runtime.
