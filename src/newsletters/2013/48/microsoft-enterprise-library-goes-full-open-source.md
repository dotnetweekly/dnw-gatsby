Microsoft Enterprise Library has a long and prominent history. Over the years, it has evolved into a mature collection of application blocks, each focused on addressing specific cross-cutting concern. New blocks have been introduced, while others become deprecated with the evolution of the .NET Framework and other Microsoft technologies.

In <a href="http://microsoft.com/practices">p&amp;p</a> we highly value openness and transparency, and we always look for opportunities to encourage these values. That’s why we are particularly thrilled and proud to announce the <strong>Open Development Model</strong> for all application blocks which make up Microsoft Enterprise Library.
