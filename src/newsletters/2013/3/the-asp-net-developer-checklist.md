In the beginning of January, we released the <a href="http://webdevchecklist.com/">Web Developer Checklist</a> with great interest from the general web community. The checklist helps raising awareness of common best practices for building websites.

It was always the plan to branch the checklist out into technology specific checklists to make it even easier to apply all the best practices.

Today we’re excited to announce the first technology specific checklist – the <a href="http://webdevchecklist.com/asp.net/">ASP.NET Developer Checklist</a>. It contains links to many ASP.NET specific tools and solutions to common problems.
