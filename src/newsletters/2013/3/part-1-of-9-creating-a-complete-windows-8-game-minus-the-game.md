Emphasis on the word: COMPLETE.

(I’m going to generalize a bit here…just for argument’s sake)

Developers like solving problems, making stuff work, figuring things out, fixing bugs, adding features.  So, it’s no surprise to me that when I talk to devs about Windows 8, and explain the enormous opportunity behind developing on this platform, I can see the wheels turning in their brain, “Oooh, I’ll make a game that does A, B, C using X technology and maybe create the backend with Y, and use Z API…”  Or, if they’re new to programming, but want to get something published relatively quickly, creating games with<a href="http://yoyogames.com/gamemaker/studio" target="_blank">GameMaker</a>, <a href="http://gamesalad.com/" target="_blank">GameSalad</a> or <a href="https://www.scirra.com/" target="_blank">Construct 2</a>, “I’ll make a platformer, kinda like Mario, but with a little bit of Angry Birds mixed in…”

I love the enthusiasm, excitement and gumption to get started with Windows 8!  <strong>However, there’s a trend of diving right into code with minimal thought which I think can hurt your game in the long run.</strong>
