This July, Microsoft is flying hundreds of brilliant students from all over the planet to St. Petersburg, Russia, for the Imagine Cup Worldwide Finals. These students will show us their most cutting-edge technology projects, a feast of creativity and innovation that culminates in our awards ceremony hosted by Matt Smith of BBC'sÂ <i>Doctor Who</i>. We've got more than one million dollars in prizes for these students and we can't wait to see who will take home the Imagine Cup!
