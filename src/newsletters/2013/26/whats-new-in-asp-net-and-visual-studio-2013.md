It keeps getting better. Join Hanselman for an update on all the webby goodness coming in the next version of Visual Studio. We’ve got a new ASP.NET dialog, amazing CSS3 support, new scaffolding engine and an amazing new surprise code-named “Artery.” We’ll cover ASP.NET MVC 5, Web API 2, Web Forms, SignalR 2, and also learn about OWIN, ASP.NET identity improvements and much more!
