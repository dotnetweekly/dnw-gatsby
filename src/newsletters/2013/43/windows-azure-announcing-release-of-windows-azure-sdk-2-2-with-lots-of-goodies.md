Earlier today <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2013/10/22/windows-azure-backup-services-release-hyper-v-recovery-manager-vm-enhancements-enhanced-enterprise-management-support.aspx" target="_blank">I blogged about a big update</a> we made today to Windows Azure, and some of the great new features it provides. Today I’m also excited to also announce the release of the Windows Azure SDK 2.2. Today’s SDK release adds even more great features.
