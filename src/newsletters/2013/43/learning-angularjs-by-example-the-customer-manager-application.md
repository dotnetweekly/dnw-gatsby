I’m always tinkering around with different ideas and toward the beginning of 2013 decided to build a sample application using <a href="http://angularjs.org" target="_blank">AngularJS</a> that I call <strong><a href="https://github.com/DanWahlin/CustomerManagerStandard" target="_blank">Customer Manager</a></strong>. It’s not exactly the most creative name or concept, but I wanted to build something that highlighted a lot of the different features offered by AngularJS and how they could be used together to build a full-featured app. One of the goals of the application was to ensure that it was approachable by people new to Angular since I’ve never found overly complex applications great for learning new concepts.
