Visual Studio 2013 Preview (internally called VS12) and .NET Framework 4.5.1 have been made available in June. Though released sooner than expected, it provides new features and improvements over Visual Studio 2012. In this article I will discuss some of the changes for native development. A more rigorous list of features is available in <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/vstudio/hh409293(v=vs.120).aspx">MSDN</a>. Visual Studio 2013 can be downloaded fromÂ <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/2013-downloads">here</a>.
