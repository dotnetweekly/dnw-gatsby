This article is the first of two I’m writing for Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) and Silverlight developers who are creating Windows Store apps. This first one is more theoretical, whereas the second is more practically oriented. In this first article, I explain some of the new features in Windows Runtime andthe most common differences you’ll encounter when transitioning to Windows Store app development, coming from a world of either Windows Phone 7, WPF/Silverlight or even traditional .NET development.
