I am pleased to announce that we released the Kinect for Windows software development kit (SDK) 1.8 today. This is the fourth update to the SDK since we first released it commercially one and a half years ago. Since then, weâ€™ve seen numerous companies using Kinect for Windows worldwide, and more than 700,000 downloads of our SDK.
