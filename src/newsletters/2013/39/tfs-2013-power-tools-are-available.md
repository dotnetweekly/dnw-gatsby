I apologize for the long wait.  But, the TFS 2013 Power Tools are finally available.  There’s no new features in this release but there are a fair number of bug fixes and the Power Tools have all been updated to work with VS 2013 and TFS 2013.  Also, the version checking has been changed so that these Power Tools will also work with VS 2013 Updates – so you don’t have to wait for a new version of the Power Tools for every VS Update.  And, of course, these will work with VS 2013 RTM.  We are not planning another Power Tools Update for RTM unless people find significant issues that need addressing.
