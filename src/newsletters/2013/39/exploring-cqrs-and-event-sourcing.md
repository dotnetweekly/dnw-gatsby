The project is focused on building highly scalable, highly available and maintainable applications with the Command & Query Responsibility Segregation and the Event Sourcing patterns.
The project was positioned as a learning journey. This guidance is designed to help you get started with the CQRS pattern and event sourcing. It is not intended to be the definitive guide to the CQRS pattern and event sourcing. Instead, it's a journal that describes the experiences of a development team with no prior CQRS proficiency in building, deploying (to Windows Azure), and maintaining a sample real-world complex enterprise system as a reference implementation (RI) to showcase various CQRS and ES concepts & techniques. The development team did not work in isolation; we actively sought input from industry experts and from a wider group of advisors to ensure that the guidance is both detailed and practical.
The CQRS pattern and event sourcing are not mere simplistic solutions to the problems associated with large-scale, distributed systems. By providing you with both a working application and written guidance, we expect you'll be well prepared to embark on your own CQRS journey.
