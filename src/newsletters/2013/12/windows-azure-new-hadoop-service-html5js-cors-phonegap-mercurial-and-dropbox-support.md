Today we released a number of great enhancements to Windows Azure. These new capabilities include:
Mobile Services: HTML5/JS (CORS) Client + PhoneGap + Windows Phone 7.5 + .NET Portable Library support<br/>
Web Sites: Mercurial Source Control + Dropbox Deployment support<br/>
HDInsight: New service that enables you to easily deploy and manage Hadoop Clusters on Azure<br/>

All of these improvements are now available to start using immediately (note: some services are still in preview).
