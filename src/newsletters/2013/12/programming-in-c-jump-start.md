This course covers C#, Microsoftâ€™s managed C-style language for the .Net Framework. In typical Jump Start fashion, this session will be engaging and demo rich. Microsoft Technical Evangelist Jerry Nixon and the co-founder of Crank211, Daren May, provide sample after sample to show simple and complex techniques you can take back to your workplace.
