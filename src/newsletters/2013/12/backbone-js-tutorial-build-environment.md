This new Backbone.js tutorial series will walk you through building a single page web application that has a customised <a href="http://backbonejs.org/#Sync">Backbone.sync</a> implementation. I started building the application that these tutorials are based on back in August, and it’s been running smoothly for a few months now so I thought it was safe enough to unleash it.
