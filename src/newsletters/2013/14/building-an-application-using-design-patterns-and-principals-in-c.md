This article will be part I in a series of articles describing how to build a software application in c# using common enterprise architecture principles and design patterns. It will start by giving code examples of how it might be done in a quick and dirty yet not ideal way and then will explain how you re factor the code to make it adhere more to common coding guidelines. I'll assume the reader is familiar with C# and basic Object Oriented Principles. I will be making referencing to SOLID principles and certain design patterns.
