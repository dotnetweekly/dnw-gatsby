The third update of Visual Studio 2012 has progressed to  Release Candidate (RC) stage, and is now available as a "go-live" version,  meaning you can put it on a production server. The first Community Technology Preview (CTP) of VS 2012,  Update 3 was released last month. That iteration wasn't for production. This RC version of Update 3 is  for both Visual Studio and Team Foundation Server (TFS).
