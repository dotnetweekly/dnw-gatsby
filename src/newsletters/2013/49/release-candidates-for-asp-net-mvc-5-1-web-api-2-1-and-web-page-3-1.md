Today we shipped release candidates for ASP.NET MVC 5.1, ASP.NET Web Pages 3.1 and Web API 2.1 to the NuGet gallery. In this release we are previewing some of the runtime features in ASP.NET and Web Tools 2013.2, which will include a broader set of updates to ASP.NET SignalR, ASP.NET Identity, Entity Framework, and the Microsoft OWIN Components as well as tooling updates to the Web Editors, Browser Link, Scaffolding, NuGet and Windows Azure WebSite publishing. We will be previewing all of these features along the way before all of the features are released.
