Hey guys. Today I'm happy to announce the release of a free book I've written called 'Essential JavaScript & jQuery Design Patterns For Beginners'. Design patterns are reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems in software development and are a very useful tool to have at your disposal.

I wanted to write this mini-book was because I felt that patterns were an area a lot of new and intermediate JavaScript developers may not have had a chance to explore just yet and I'm hopeful my book will encourage you to check them out as they can be quite powerful.
