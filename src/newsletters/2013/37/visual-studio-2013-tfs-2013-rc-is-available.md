Today we released the Release Candidate for the VS 2013 suite of products.  This is a “go-live” production worthy version and will likely be the last publicly available build before we RTM.  I strongly encourage you to try it out and let us know if you find any blocking issues.  The clock is ticking and time is running out for us to make any more changes before the product ships.
