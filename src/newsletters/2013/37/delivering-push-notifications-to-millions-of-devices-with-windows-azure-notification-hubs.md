<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh779722.aspx" target="_blank">Push notifications</a> are a vital component of connected apps. They allow back-end services to send frequent and timely updates to specific users and devices that can then appear as tile updates, toast notifications, badge updates, and more. (See the three-part series, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsappdev/archive/2013/02/21/alive-with-activity-part-1-working-with-tiles-badges-and-toasts.aspx" target="_blank">Alive with Activity</a> for more background.) As such, push notifications are perhaps the most powerful customer engagement mechanism available to app developers across phones, tablets, and PCs.
