Language Integrated Query (LINQ) is a Microsoft .NET Framework component that extends the language by the addition of query expressions, which are akin to SQL statements, and can be used to conveniently extract and process data from arrays. JavaScript built-in API since ECMAScript 5th Edition comes with a very limited set of iteration methods: forEach, every, some, filter, map, reduce and reduceRight.
