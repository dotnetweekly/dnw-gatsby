Developers who are writing Windows Store apps using C# and XAML might find some of the support for Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) lacking. Both WPF and Silverlight provided specific interfaces that enabled you to store validation context about fields on a context and even supported asynchronous validation. Although there are some existing frameworks that provide this support, such as <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/xx130660.aspx" target="_blank">Prism for the Windows Runtime</a>, it is also fairly simple and straightforward to roll your own.
