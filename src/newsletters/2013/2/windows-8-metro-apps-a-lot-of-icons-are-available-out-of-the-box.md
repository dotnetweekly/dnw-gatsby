When I first looked for the icons, I<strong> first searched for pictures</strong>. I found none of them.
So I digged a little more on the sample and <strong>I found out that icons where here as a Font.</strong>

This is in fact a <strong>really good idea for several reasons</strong> :
<ol>
	<li>Fonts are vectorial.</li>
	<li>You can choose the colors of the icons just by changing a parameters.</li>
	<li>No need to add a lot of images files to your project</li>
	<li>It’s really easy to use/code !</li>
</ol>
