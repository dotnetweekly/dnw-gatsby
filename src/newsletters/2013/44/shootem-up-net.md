I know that many programmers would love to write games. I myself started to program computers because I wanted to create games and, even if I already wrote some games, I've spent most of my time dealing with systems and solving problems related to database connectivity and better caching mechanisms. My idea on writing games without using <em>XNA</em> or <em>Unity</em> is to show that you can use normal UI technologies to write games, which in many cases simplify the job as you don't need to care about how to render things to the screen or to recreate layout controls.
