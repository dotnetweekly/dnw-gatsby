Among the deluge of Visual Studio 2013 releases in October, we shipped the 2013 release of <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40785">Team Explorer Everywhere</a> – updating the experience for team members working in Eclipse and/or on non-Windows environments.  Team Explorer Everywhere includes an Eclipse plug-in, a cross-platform command line client, and a Java SDK for building custom tools that access TFS.
