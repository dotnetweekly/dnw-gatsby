Object-Relational Mapping frameworks are a convenient way to provide an abstraction for data access in an object-oriented application. For .NET applications, Microsoft's recommended O/RM is the Entity Framework. With any abstraction though, performance can become a concern.

This whitepaper was written to show the performance considerations when developing applications using the Entity Framework, to give developers an idea of the Entity Framework internal algorithms that can affect performance, and to provide tips for investigation and improving performance in their applications that use the Entity Framework.
