The Observer Pattern is one of the most  frequently used object-oriented software design patterns. It creates a  one-to-many relationship between two objects that allows one or many observed  objects to be updated by the subject object. The Observer Pattern is the  foundation of the Model View Controller (MVC) pattern, in which a view is  updated automatically whenever the model's state changes. In the .NET Framework,  delegates with events are an implementation of the  Observer pattern.
