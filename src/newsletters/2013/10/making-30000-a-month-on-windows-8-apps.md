Why should developers build Windows 8 apps? <a href="http://apps.microsoft.com/webpdp/app/card-games-chest/2634d007-ff3a-4697-a44e-f34f42128785">Card Games Chest </a>is one of my Windows 8 apps, together the apps are making more than $30,000 per month in ad revenue and sales (in-app purchase and ads, apps are free), the top app alone made around $20K. The apps enjoyed a hockey-stick growth in the number of downloads. Windows 8 was launched just a few months ago, and already it’s generating revenue for the first apps in the market.
