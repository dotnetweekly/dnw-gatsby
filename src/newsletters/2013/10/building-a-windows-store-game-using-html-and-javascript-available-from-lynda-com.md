I am proud to announce my first course with Lynda.com is <a href="http://bit.ly/lyndawin8games">now available</a> for viewing!  The course runs a little over two hours in length, includes complete source code, and step-by-step labs for each chapter.  I’ve never been a fan of having to spend hours going through an SDK and the intent of this course is to learn from example.  I move you from having no tools installed on your machine to a complete game you can then download and modify as you wish.  In fact, I published the game created in the course to the Windows Store recently so if you have a Windows 8 machine be sure to <a href="http://bit.ly/balloonswin8">check it out</a>.
