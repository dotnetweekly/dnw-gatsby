A couple of months back we released EF6 Alpha 2, since then we've been adding new features, polishing existing features and fixing bugs. Today we are pleased to announce the availability of Alpha 3. EF6 is being developed in an open source code base on CodePlex, see our <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/adonet/archive/2012/07/19/entity-framework-and-open-source.aspx">open source announcement</a> for more details.
