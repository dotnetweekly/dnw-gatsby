It is not a new topic, yet it can’t be old. This topic is a very important to know, and the deeper you know about it, the stronger grasp you will have on the .NET platform. Nowadays, and especially after .NET 4.0, I see asynchronous programming has become a trend that everyone is following. If you have built a platform or a framework or even a class library, and you still want to support it, it is highly recommended to create asynchronous counterparts for each and every time-consuming method you have in your library.
