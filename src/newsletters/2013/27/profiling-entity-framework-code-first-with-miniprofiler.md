<p align="justify">When I tried to find an up to date tutorial on using <a href="http://miniprofiler.com/" target="_blank">MiniProfiler</a> with Entity Framework Code First I couldn’t find any that I could use – all either referred old versions of assemblies or didn’t include all information, so here is one.</p>
<p align="justify"><a href="http://miniprofiler.com/" target="_blank">MiniProfiler</a> presents itself as a “simple but effective mini-profiler for .NET and Ruby”, and indeed it is! Let’s forget about the Ruby part, which I don’t know: it offers an interesting, non-intrusive approach to getting simple performance measures for the execution of ASP.NET MVC action methods and, what interests me more, database calls, such as those produced by EF. Its pluggable nature, however, can potentially lend itself to other uses – more on this on a future post.</p>
