Attention iOS! Join this Jump Start to learn how to develop and monetize apps for Windows Store. We are excited to present Microsoft Principal Technical Evangelist <a href="http://twitter.com/jaimerodriguez">Jaime Rodriguez</a> and Big Nerd Ranch trainers <a href="http://twitter.com/bignerdranch">Eric Jeffers</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/bignerdranch">Sean McCune</a> to share some of their lessons learned in transitioning from iOS to Windows Store development. We will use iOS terms and concepts to explain features in Windows, ensuring that you can make use of what you already know and learn the new concepts in your own terms. Register now for a packed, fun-filled, interactive event.
