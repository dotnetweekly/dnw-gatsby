And now for some exciting news: you can <em>finally</em> use WCF Data Services with Entity Framework 6+! Today we are uploading a new NuGet package called <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.OData.EntityFrameworkProvider/1.0.0-alpha1">WCF Data Services Entity Framework Provider</a>. This NuGet package bridges the gap between WCF Data Services 5.6.0 and Entity Framework 6+. We were able to build this provider as an out-of-band provider (that is, a provider that ships apart from the core WCF DS stack) because of the public provider work we did recently.
