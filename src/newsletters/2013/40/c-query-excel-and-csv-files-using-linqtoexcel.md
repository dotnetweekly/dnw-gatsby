In my quest to get a rather hack-ey work project DONE and off my machine, I discovered a couple exceptionally useful OSS tools for working with MS Excel data, and at the same time, I also found a handy library, DocX, for working with MS Word files which not only spares one the issues of Interop/COM, but in fact does not require Interop assemblies at all. In fact, it doesn't even require that Word be installed on your machine at all.
