We'll kick off this fun event with a free launch session and live chat on June 15, where you'll learn how to develop, upload and publish a Windows 8 game to the Windows Store. Using the popular, free tool, <a href="http://aka.ms/yoyogamesgamemaker">GameMaker: Studio</a> from YoYo Games, both novices and professional developers can create and publish high-quality games faster than ever before. And don't think the support stops there. We've got your back all week long with one-on-one assistance through the GameMaker forums, plus an online Help Centre that's ready and willing to answer your questions. Need another reason to get started? Publish your app before June 30, 2013 and receive a $100 virtual Visa card for every qualified app that you <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/click/services/Redirect2.ashx?CR_CC=200228895">enter</a>(up to $2,000*).
