The Prototype Pattern is a common creational design pattern whereby an object is cloned to create new objects. The pattern is traditionally used where creating a new instance of an object would be prohibitive. The pattern is also great when you want to make copies of an object with slight variations and don't want to be concerned with how the object has been created.
