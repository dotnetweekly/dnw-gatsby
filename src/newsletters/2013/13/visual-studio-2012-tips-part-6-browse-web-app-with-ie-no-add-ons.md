The last two weeks I have been developing an application that creates Sales Orders from a web interface. The application is used to return damaged watches and sunglasses to the repair centre.

It creates a Sales Order entry in SYSPRO and makes use of various custom fields to store data not available in SYSPRO. The application wasn’t very complicated, but did take a few days to complete.

During this development, I came across a nice quick tip (see reference below) when browsing ASP.NET pages in Visual Studio that allows you to specify that you need to browse with a Browser (IE in this case) sans the add-ons. I wanted to share this here.
