<div>SIM.JS (project website) is a general-purpose Discrete Event Simulation library written entirely in JavaScript and capable of running on a web browser. SIM.JS is a library for modeling discrete time event systems: The library provides constructs to create Entities which are the active actors in the system and encapsulates the state and logic of components in a system.</div>
