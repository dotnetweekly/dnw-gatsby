If you’ve already done some web development, it’s likely you’ve used the open source JavaScript framework jQuery. And if you’ve tried building Windows Store apps using jQuery, you might have run into errors related to JavaScript runtime or dynamic content. With the upcoming release of v2.0, the jQuery team has addressed these concerns. The jQuery v2 beta now supports development in HTML5/JS for Windows Store apps. As a web developer, you can use your existing skills and assets to build awesome apps for Windows 8.
