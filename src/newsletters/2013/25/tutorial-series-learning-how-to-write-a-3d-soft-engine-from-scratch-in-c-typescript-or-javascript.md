I’d to like to share with you how I’ve learned to build what’s known as a “<strong>3D soft engine</strong>” through a series of tutorials. “Software engine” means that we <strong>will use only the CPU</strong> to build a 3D engine in an old school way (remember Doom on your 80386 ?). I’ll share with you the <strong>C#, TypeScript and JavaScript</strong> versions of the code. In this list, you should then find your favorite language or at least something near your favorite one. The idea is to help you transposing the following samples &amp; concepts on your favorite platform. You’ll find the Visual Studio 2012 C#/TS/JS solutions to download at the end also.
