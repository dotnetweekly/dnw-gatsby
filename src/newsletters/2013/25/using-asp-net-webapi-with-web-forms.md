Asp.Net WebAPI is a framework for building RESTful HTTP services which can be used across a wide range of clients including web, phone and desktop applications. With WebAPI we can use XML and JSON to send and retrieve data from the service. The use of Json or XML makes it quite flexible to be used across a variety of devices.
