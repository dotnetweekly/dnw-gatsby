Backing up WordPress can be a pain on the windows platform. Some plug-ins work, some don’t, maybe you need a mixture of this or that. There are commercial options, some a great, some not so much.  After trying various options, I broke down and decided to create a process to backup WordPress on Windows. This process uses a batch file and can use the Windows Scheduler to automatically execute whenever you want.

At the end of the day, all you want is your WordPress content and database backed up.
