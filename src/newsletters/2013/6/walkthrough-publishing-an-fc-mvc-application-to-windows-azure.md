In this walkthrough and its accompanying sample, you’ll use C# and F# to start developing web applications and cloud services that are hosted in Windows Azure. By following this walkthrough, you’ll get a web application, the WordGrid sample, running in Windows Azure as a cloud service. You can use that sample to explore how to integrate F# with a C# web application and, in general, how to use the power of F# in Windows Azure. The sample uses the ASP.NET Model View Controller (MVC) 4 framework, which provides a powerful and versatile library for web applications. By using this framework, you can separate the application’s layout and UI (the "View" in MVC) from its program logic (the "Model"). MVC applications also include controllers that handle and route incoming requests. For each request, the controllers determine which view to render with which model.
