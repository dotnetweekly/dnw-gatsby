If you've written a game for the Windows Store or for Windows Phone, you may have noticed that some markets require the use of game rating certificates. If you're like me, your initial reaction may have been "that looks hard" and as a result just skipped the process and only published where certificates aren't required (for example, here in the United States, ESRB certification is optional).
