BrowserStack has a cloud of virtual machines with every browser imaginable. You can pick your OS, browser version and screen resolution, then effectively VNC (Remote) into them with their Flash plugin. It's totally seamless and really cool to see. <a href="http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/2dfa32b1-3c47-439d-b1c5-9e28be18b81c">BrowserStack already has a lovely Visual Studio Extension</a> up and ready to go.  It adds BrowserStack as a new browser choice within your Visual Studio 2012 debug dropdown.
