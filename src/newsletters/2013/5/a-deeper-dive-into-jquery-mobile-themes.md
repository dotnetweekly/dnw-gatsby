The first article (<a id="ctl00_MTContentSelector1_mainContentContainer_ctl01" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/jj835091.aspx">Introduction to jQuery Mobile</a>) in this series looked at the subject of themes at a high level and at themes available in jQuery Mobile (jQM). In this, the third of three articles on jQM, I show how to build a custom theme using the Theme Roller, as well as look at some custom themes that allow a mobile Web application to look more like an iPhone, Android or Windows Phone application.
