The purpose of this small <em>.aspx</em> web app is to allow users to execute SQL Stored Procedures. It will build an input form to gather parameter information and return the results generated by the stored proc to a simple gridview or as an <em>.xlsx</em> file downloaded directly to the userâ€™s PC. It allows developers to exclusively work in SQL. When the stored proc is complete, it can be made available for users to call by just calling the <em>.aspx</em> page and passing it the name of the Stored Proc. It was designed mainly to allow developers to create parameter-based queries in the form of SQL Stored Procedures and turn them directly over to users without any additional coding.
