Recently, I started researching tools and services for the build automation. Being a long user of TeamCity and currently Travis CI (also had some experience with Jenkins, AppVeyor and VSTS) I wanted to find out what else is there. Then I realized that thereâ€™s a build server built into BitBucket, thus I decided to give it a go.
