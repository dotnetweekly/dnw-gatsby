If you’re like me, you probably go through three stages when hearing about a new technology:
1. Dismissal
One more JavaScript library?! Just use jQuery already!
2. Interest
Hmm, maybe I should check out this new library I keep hearing about…
3. Panic
Help! I need to learn this new library right now or I’ll be completely obsolete!
