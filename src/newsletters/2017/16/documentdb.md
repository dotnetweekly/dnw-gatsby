DocumentDB is Microsoft's cloud-first database solution for schema-less data. With DocumentDB you can query any collection of JSON data with SQL and JavaScript, and because it's designed for the cloud, you get guaranteed low latency, global replication, unlimited scale and a usage-based pricing model based on storage and throughput.
