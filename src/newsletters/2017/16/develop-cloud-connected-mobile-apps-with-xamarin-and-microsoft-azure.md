Welcome to my first book. It's free, it's open source, and it's comprehensive. Those attributes also describe two of my favorite technologies. The first is Xamarin Forms , a technology that allows you to develop cross-platform mobile applications using C# and the .NET framework. The second is Azure Mobile Apps, a technology that allows you to connect your mobile app to resources that are important in cloud connected mobile applications such as table data, authentication, and push notifications.
