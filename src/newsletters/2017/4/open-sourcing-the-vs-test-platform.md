Yesterday we released our unit test execution infrastructure as an <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/vstest">open source project</a>.  You’ll also find an <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/vstest-docs">open source project with the documentation</a>. VSTest is a very extensible unit test execution framework.  The base engine, discovers tests and runs them.  It can parallelize across cores, provides process isolation and can integrate with Visual Studio.  It has extensibility for different test frameworks, code coverage, test impact analysis, data collection, test result reporting and much more.
