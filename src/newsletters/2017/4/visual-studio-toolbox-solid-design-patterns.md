In <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Visual-Studio-Toolbox/SOLID-Design-Patterns">this episode</a>, I am joined by <a href="http://www.twitter.com/skimedic">Phil Japikse</a> for a chat about design patterns. Software design patterns have been around long before the MVC Framework gained momentum. Phil starts with a review of Robert C. Martin’s (Uncle Bob) SOLID macronym. After building the proper foundation,he reviews several design patterns, their C# implementation and when and how they should be used in modern software development.
