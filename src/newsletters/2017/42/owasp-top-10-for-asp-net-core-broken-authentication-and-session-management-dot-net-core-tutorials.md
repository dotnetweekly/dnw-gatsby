In our previous article on the OWASP Top 10 we talked about SQL Injection. Where SQL Injection has a pretty definitive explanation and examples, this next one on “Broken Authentication and Session Management” is a bit more open ended. It covers everything from bad password storage systems (Plain text, weak hashing) to exposing of a session to a user that can then be stolen (For example a session string in a URL) all the way to simple things such as timing out a authenticated session.
