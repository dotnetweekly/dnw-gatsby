I have to start somewhere so I started wtih super baby steps. Downloading the .NET Core 2 nightly build and trying to create a simple console app. Right away I failed miserably. The reason? The nightly builds have already jumped the shark! They are working on 2.1.0 and I accidentally grabbed that. And that was a little too bleeding edge for me.
