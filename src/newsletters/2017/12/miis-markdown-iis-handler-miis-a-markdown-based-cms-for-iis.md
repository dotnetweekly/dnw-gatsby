It's a easy and fast way to create professional documentation sites based on Markdown under IIS. It can be used as a simple Markdown handler to return HTML in the response, or to create full-fledged documentation systems based in easy to create (but powerful) templates. It works in Internet Information Services, locally with IISExpress (handy to develop the docs) and in Azure Web Sites.

You can create your documentation site from any Markdown files in les than 30 seconds and have a lot of control over the final result.

The project's own documentation site has been created with MIIS.
