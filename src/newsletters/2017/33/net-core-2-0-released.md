Join Scott Hunter and members of the .NET Team as they introduce you to all the new features in .NET Core 2.0, our cross-platform, open source .NET. .NET Core 2.0 implements .NET Standard 2.0 which delivers on the promise of .NET everywhere and expands the API surface area to over 35,000 members so that sharing libraries across all .NET workloads is much easier.
