Porting existing code to .NET Core used to be quite hard because the available API set was very small. In .NET Core 2.0, we already made this much easier, thanks to .NET Standard 2.0. Today, weâ€™re happy to announce that we made it even easier with the Windows Compatibility Pack, which provides access to an additional 20,000 APIs via a single NuGet package.
