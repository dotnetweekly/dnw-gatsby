Being a modern language with access to a rich ecosystem of libraries, C# can be immensely helpful both for automation and data processing in Excel. The goal of QueryStorm in this regard is to make C# easily available in Excel in order to help developers, db professionals and data scientists make better use of Excel. The C# scripting engine in QueryStorm is powered by the Roslyn compiler.
