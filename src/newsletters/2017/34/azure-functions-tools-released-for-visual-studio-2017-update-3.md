We’re excited to announce that Azure Functions tools for Visual Studio are out of preview! The tools are now included in the Azure workload of Visual Studio 2017 Update 3. Just update your existing VS 2017 installation to Update 3–there’s no need to use the preview channel or manually install the Functions tooling extension.
