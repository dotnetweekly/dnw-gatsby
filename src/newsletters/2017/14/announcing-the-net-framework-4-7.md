Today, we are announcing the release of the .NET Framework 4.7. It’s included in the Windows 10 Creators Update. We’ve added support for targeting the .NET Framework 4.7 in Visual Studio 2017, also updated today. The .NET Framework 4.7 will be released for additional Windows versions soon. We’ll make an announcement when we have the final date.
