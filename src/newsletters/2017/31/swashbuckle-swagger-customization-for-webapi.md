Who has ever tested their WebAPI knows such tools as Postman or Advanced REST (extensions for Chrome). These tools are convenient in every way, except that they are not able to recognize which models the API accepts, which ones it returns and do not provide information about all possible endpoints. The Swashbuckle package solves this disadvantage.
