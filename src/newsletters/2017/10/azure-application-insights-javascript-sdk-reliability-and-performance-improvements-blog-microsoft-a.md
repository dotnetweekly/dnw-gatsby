With Azure Application Insights you can monitor performance and usage of your apps. With a little snippet of JavaScript you can get timings of page loads and AJAX calls, counts and details of browser exceptions and AJAX failures, as well as users and session counts. To learn more how to get started you can visit our documentation.
