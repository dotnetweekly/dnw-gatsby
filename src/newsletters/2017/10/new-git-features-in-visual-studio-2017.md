We’ve added new Git features to Visual Studio 2017 that allow you to do more of your end-to-end workflow without leaving the IDE. You can perform a force push to complete a rebase or push an amended commit, easily view the diff for outgoing commits, unset your upstream branch, and continue patch rebase from VS. Additionally, because we moved to git.exe–which allows us to provide the most up-to-date features–we support SSH, respect your config options, and show in Team Explorer exactly what you see in the command line. Learn more about all of our <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/git/gitquickstart">Git features in Visual Studio</a> and check out the <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/release-notes/">Visual Studio release notes</a> for what’s new in Visual Studio 2017.
