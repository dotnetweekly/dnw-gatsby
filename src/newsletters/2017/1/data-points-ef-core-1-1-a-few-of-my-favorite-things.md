As Iâ€™m writing this column (in November 2016), Entity Framework (EF) Core 1.1 was just released. Between the 1.0 release and 1.1, a few significant things happened. In particular, the 1.0.1 patch fixed some critical bugs that were discovered just as 1.0 was being released. For a detailed list of those fixes, you can read the release notes at <a href="http://bit.ly/2fl5xNE">bit.ly/2fl5xNE</a>. While most of these fixes relate to how LINQ queries are transformed to SQL, there are also fixes to the model builder, persistence via SaveChanges and migrations.
