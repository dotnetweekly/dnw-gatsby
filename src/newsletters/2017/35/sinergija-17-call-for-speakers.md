We invite you to be a part of Sinergija community and look forward to receiving your topic proposals, ideas and speaker suggestions for Technical days.
We are really excited about this year’s lineup of topics and to get you thinking, here are some of our picks for hot topics in 2017: Augmented Reality, Security, Cloud Apps, Gaming, Internet of Things (IoT), Digital Transformation and many more. Please see below the full list of topics.

The key word is NEW. We are interested in selecting speakers who share our commitment to providing Sinergija audience with unique experiences and real-time information that matters.

Although the conference is organized by Microsoft Serbia, it not exclusively related to Microsoft technologies. It has become regional brand and synonym for everything new and relevant in the IT and Business world in general.

For the past years this network has been rapidly expanding beyond the traditional niche of IT experts and developers. Sinergija attracts about 1200 participants each year – It experts, business oriented delegates, decision makers interested in improving their business, and technology processes, as well as optimizing company resources through implementation of latest technologies.
