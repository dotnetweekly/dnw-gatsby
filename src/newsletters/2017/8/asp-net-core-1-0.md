What is ASP.NET Core 1.0? 

ASP.NET Core 1.0 is, in short terms, the evolution of ASP.NET 4.6. If you are thinking that it is just a superior version of ASP.NET 4.6 take away that myth of your head because ASP.NET Core 1.0 is an entire new based-cloud applications framework written from scratch, with a new focus different from its predecessor. 
Two of the most appreciated characteristics of this new framework are: 
First it is open source (supported by Microsoft) meaning that you can find and download the code on GitHub , also contribute to the development of it, and second, it is cross-platform, so you can run it either in Windows, Linux or Mac OS.
