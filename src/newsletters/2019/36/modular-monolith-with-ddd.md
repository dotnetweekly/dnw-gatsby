Purpose of this repository
This is list of main goals of this repository:

Showing how you can implement the monolith application in a modular way
Presentation of the full implementation of the application. This is not another simple application. This is not another proof of concept (PoC). The assumption is to present the implementation of the application that would be ready to run on production
Showing the application of best practices and object-oriented programming principles
Presentation of the use of design patterns. When, how and why they can be used
Presentation of some architectural considerations, decisions, approaches
Presentation of the implementation using Domain-Driven Design approach (tactical patterns)
