This is the first post in the series: Exploring ASP.NET Core 3.0.

Part 1 - Exploring the new project file, Program.cs, and the generic host (this post)
Part 2 - Comparing Startup.cs between the ASP.NET Core 3.0 templates
In this post I take a look at some of the fundamental pieces of ASP.NET Core 3.0 applications - the .csproj project file and the Program.cs file. I'll describe how they've changed in the default templates from ASP.NET Core 2.x, and discuss some of the changes in the the APIs they use.
