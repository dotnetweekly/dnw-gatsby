I don't believe that the web development community is having an honest discussion about GraphQL. This is because, GraphQL is almost exclusively presented as an alternative to REST (Representational State Transfer). And, while GraphQL may remove points-of-friction found in REST, the dishonesty is rooted in a false and implicit dichotomy when it comes to API implementations. The truth is, GraphQL and REST are not your only choices when it comes to building an HTTP-based API. And while this may be obvious to many experienced web application developers, it is not nearly as obvious to newcomers. As such, I think that the community should be striving to have a more nuanced conversation.
