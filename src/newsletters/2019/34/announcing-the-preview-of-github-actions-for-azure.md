On Thursday, August 8, 2019, GitHub announced the preview of GitHub Actions with support for Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD). Actions makes it possible to create simple, yet powerful pipelines and automate software compilation and delivery. Today, we are announcing the preview of GitHub Actions for Azure.

With these new Actions, developers can quickly build, test, and deploy code from GitHub repositories to the cloud with Azure.
