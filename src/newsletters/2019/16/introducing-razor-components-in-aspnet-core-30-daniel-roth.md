ASP.NET Core 3.0 introduces a new model for building rich, interactive, and composable UI called Razor Components. Razor Components are identical to components in Blazor, but now supported as a shipping feature in ASP.NET Core. With Razor Components, you get the interactivity of a client-side application, but with your app written entirely in C#.
In this talk we’ll go through the new component model in detail. I’ll show you how the same components can be run either on the server with interactivity handled over a SignalR connection or on the client via WebAssembly. We’ll also discuss how to handle issues like connection and app state management.
