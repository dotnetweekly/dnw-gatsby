Recently, Nick from Stack Overflow tweeted about his experience of using the .NET Core GC configs – he seemed quite happy with them (minus the fact they are not documented well which is something I’m talking to our doc folks about). I thought it’d be fun to tell you about the history of the GC configs ‘cause it’s almost the weekend and I want to contribute to your fun weekend reading.
