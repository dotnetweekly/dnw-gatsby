In September, we shared Visual Studio 2019 for Mac v8.3 with you – this was our biggest release yet for .NET developers working on a Mac. Today, we’d like to invite you to take part in a new community challenge in which you can interact directly with our team to improve Visual Studio for Mac, explore some great looking ASP.NET Core samples, and earn prizes!
