This is the second post in the series: Containerising Blazor Applications With Docker.

Part 1 - Containerising a Blazor Server App
Part 2 - Containerising a Blazor WebAssembly App (this post)

In part 1 of the series, we took a look Docker and some of its key concepts. Then we took the default template for a Blazor Server app and containerised it using Docker. In this post, we are going to take a look at doing the same thing but with a Blazor WebAssembly app.
