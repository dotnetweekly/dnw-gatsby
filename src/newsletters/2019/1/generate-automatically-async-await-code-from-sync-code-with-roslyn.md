This is a quick post to give you some feedback about an experiment I just made with the Scriban Text Templating Library to add support for async/await automatically from the existing synchronous code, all of this done by using Roslyn.

If you have an existing code base that works beautifully in a synchronous manner, but you would like also to provide a path for async/await patterns, you donâ€™t want to rewrite your entire code base to the async/await pattern, or to drop synchronous code for async/await only. It would either be a huge burden to maintain two code paths doing almost the same thing, or the use async/await only would actually perform significantly worse than the synchronous version, even if you are using the recently introduced ValueTask<T>
