If you are interested in Vue.js, you probably know about the 3rd version of this framework, which will be released shortly (if you are reading this article from the future, I hope itâ€™s still relevant ðŸ˜‰). The new version is under active development for now, but all possible features can be found in separate RFC (request for comments) repository: https://github.com/vuejs/rfcs. One of them, function-api, can dramatically change the style of developing Vue apps.
