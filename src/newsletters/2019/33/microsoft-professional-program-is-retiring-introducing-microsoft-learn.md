Three years ago, we launched the Microsoft Professional Program (MPP) with one mission: to help you build the technical skills you need to succeed in emerging jobs.

Since that time, the importance of technical skills and industry-recognized certifications has grown.

Research tells us that:

Certified new hires reach full productivity sooner and find more opportunities for advancement.
Certified employees earn 15 percent more than those without certification.
Employees with certifications are nearly 20 percent more productive.
That’s why we’ve decided to evolve our approach into a program where you can work toward a technical certification. How?

To help you succeed, we have created Microsoft Learn—a free, interactive way of learning that helps you prepare for certifications. It combines short step-by-step tutorials, interactive browser-based coding/scripting environments, and task-based achievements.

As we retire MPP, Microsoft Learn becomes your destination for building the skills you need to be successful.
