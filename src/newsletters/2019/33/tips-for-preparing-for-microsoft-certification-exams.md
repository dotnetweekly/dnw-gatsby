To pass a certification exam and earn a Microsoft certification requires being prepared and knowing the content being tested. This can come from experience using the technologies, however, this doesn’t get you 100% of the way to passing through experience alone. Often you don’t use all the technologies and do all the tasks covered on the exam through your daily job duties. As a result, you will need to study.

The keys to preparing for Microsoft certification exams are finding all the right study tools and materials necessary for your learning style. It also helps to go through a practice test of some kind to help prepare and really drill in the memorization of the technical knowledge required.
