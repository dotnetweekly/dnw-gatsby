Last time I scratched the surface of creating databases and collections in Azure Cosmos using the emulator and some C# code written using .NET Core. This time I’m going to dig a bit deeper into how to query these databases and collections with C#, and show a few code snippets that I’m using to help remove cruft from my classes. I’m also going write a little about Indexing Policies and how to use them to do useful string comparison queries.
