In this two-day workshop you'll learn the basics of frontend development while building a working web app.

The first day provides an introduction to the fundamentals of the web: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This is targeted at new and experienced developers alike. On the second day we'll dive into more advanced topics like TypeScript, testing, and state management. While the examples should be accessible to anyone, you'll get the most out of it if you have some prior experience with programming and web technologies.
