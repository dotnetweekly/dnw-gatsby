Mi­crosoft has re­cently in­tro­duced a Ser­vice Fab­ric Mesh ser­vice. It is a con­tainer or­ches­tra­tion ser­vice like Ku­ber­netes. The name suggests that it has some­thing com­mon with Ser­vice Fab­ric. When you want to mi­grate a clas­si­cal ser­vice, you can con­sider Ser­vice Fab­ric Mesh. How­ever, this is not true for na­tive Ser­vice Fab­ric ser­vices. Ser­vice Fab­ric Mesh is more about tool­ing au­tom­a­ti­za­tion and host­ing of­fer­ings than tech­no­log­i­cal fea­tures.
