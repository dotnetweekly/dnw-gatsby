The .NET Core 3.0 Preview 1 hit the streets on December 4th at Connect() 2018 and for some of us, it’s the biggest release since 1.0. If you’re looking for new features, performance enhancements, and bug fixes for ASP.NET Core, Web API, or Entity Framework Core, let me stop you right there. Yes, 3.0 has all that, but if that’s what you’re looking for, you can find all that in 2.2, which is already ready for prime-time use.
