TypeScript is more and more becoming a common choice to make when starting a new React project. It’s already being used on some high profile projects, such as MobX, Apollo Client, and even VS Code itself, which has amazing TypeScript support. That makes sense since both TypeScript and VS Code are made by Microsoft! Luckily it’s very easy to use now on a new create-react-app, Gatsby, or Next.js project.
