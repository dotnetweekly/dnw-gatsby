We all heard about WASM, capabilities, and possibilities. Other languages and runtimes such as Rust have their official way to run their code in the browser and for .NET, the only official way is to use Blazor which is a front-end framework.

Blazor is good, but itâ€™s a complete package for developing the whole frontend application. What if I like to use .NET libraries inside my old JS application that is already in production?
