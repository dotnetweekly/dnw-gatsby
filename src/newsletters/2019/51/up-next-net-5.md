Now that Microsoft has shipped .NET Core 3.1, the next stop on the .NET Core roadmap is just plain old .NET 5 with no "Core" and no "Framework" -- it's all just .NET from here on.

Due in November 2020, .NET 5 will mark the company's transformation from the aging, proprietary, Windows-only .NET Framework to a modern, open-source, cross-platform .NET.
