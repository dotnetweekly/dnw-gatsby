Querying hierarchical data is always where the big boys of SQL shined. And I really mean the big boys part since only Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server have support for CTE [As Thomas Levesque pointed out in the comments, not only those have support for CTE. Full list on wikipedia] (Common Table Expressions) that allow for executing one SQL statement what will fetch a subtree. There are data modeling approaches that allow for doing hierarchical data reads with noSQL databases and databases without support for CTE.
