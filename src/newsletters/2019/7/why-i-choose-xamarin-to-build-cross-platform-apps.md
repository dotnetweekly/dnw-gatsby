It has been a little over 7 years since I left my day job at Canon crafting wonderful printer workflow management software, to dive into the world of mobile development. At the time it was an extremely tough decision because I had been only working on desktop Windows Forms and WPF applications, and this change meant entering a whole new unknown world of platforms that I didn't know much about. This move was not only changing my main day job, but also the city that I lived in with a fresh start in Seattle. At the time I didn't know what I was in for since the change in my career and living situation was so drastic. I was so lucky to have had the option to explore cross-platform technologies which is what led me to find Xamarin. Finding this single piece of technology completely shifted and revolutionized my entire life as a developer. I thought what time is better than now to reflect back on my love for this technology that put me where I am today.
