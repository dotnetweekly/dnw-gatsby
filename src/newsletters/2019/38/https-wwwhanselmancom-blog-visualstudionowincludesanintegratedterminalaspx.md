It's early days (preview) but there's now a Terminal integrated into Visual Studio! Taking a nod from the 2017 plugin, the Terminal is now build in as an experimental feature using features from the NEW open source Windows Terminal.

Rather than build everything from scratch, the Visual Studio terminal shares most of its core with the Windows Terminal!

assuming you have Visual Studio 2019 16.3 Preview 3 or above, youâ€™ll want to enable it by visiting the Preview Features page. Go to Tools > Options > Preview Features, enable the Experimental VS Terminal option and restart Visual Studio.
