Every developer wants to build a system that never breaks, but in reality things go wrong. The best systems are built to expect that and handle problems, that rather than just silently failing.

Maybe your database becomes unavailable (e.g. runs out of hard disk space) and your failover doesn’t work – or maybe a third party web service that you depend on stops working.
