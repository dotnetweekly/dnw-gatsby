ASP.NET Core 3 is Microsoftâ€™s server-side application framework designed for implementing modern architectures with modern security requirements.

In this talk we will have a look at the various security services that come with ASP.NET Core and how they fit into the bigger picture of the security architecture. We will have a look at features like hosting, data protection, authentication & authorization, ASP.NET Identity and the new IdentityServer integration for standard-based access control for APIs.
