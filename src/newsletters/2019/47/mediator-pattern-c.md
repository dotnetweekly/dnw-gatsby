The Mediator pattern in C# enables objects to communicate, without knowing each otherâ€™s identities. It also encapsulates a protocol that objects can follow.

You can think of a Mediator object as a kind of a coordinator; that handles traffic between appropriate parties based on its own logic.

Mediator promotes loose coupling by keeping objects from referring to each other explicitly, and it lets you vary their interaction independently.
