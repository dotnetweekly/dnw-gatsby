Authentication and Authorization are two terms you would often come across when reading about the security of web applications. While the former is used to validate a user’s credentials, the latter is used to grant access to one or more resources of the application to a user. There are two ways in which you can implement authorization in ASP.NET Core. These include role-based authorization and policy-based authorization. Role-based authorization has been in use from the previous versions of ASP.NET. Policy-based authorization has been newly introduced in ASP.NET Core and provides a rich, expressive and reusable authorization model to secure applications developed in ASP.NET Core. This article presents a discussion on how you can work with policy-based authorization in ASP.NET Core.
