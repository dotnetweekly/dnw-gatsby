Of course Docker is still here, and of course everyone is still using Docker and will continue to do so the near and foreseeable future (how far that foreseeable future is - is yet to be determined). The reason I chose this title for the blogpost is because, in my humble opinion the days for Docker as a company are numbered and maybe also a technology as well. If would indulge me with a few minutes of your time - I will share with you the basis for my thoughts.
