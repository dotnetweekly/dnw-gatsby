In this article we describe how to build a UWP app that uses the gRPC protocol -the new WCF- to communicate with a remote host application running on ASP.NET Core 3.0. Weâ€™ll discuss:

defining the service model,
generating client and server code,
executing simple RPC calls,
executing server-side streaming RPC calls,
executing client-side streaming RPC calls, and 
executing bidirectional streaming calls.
