In our previous post, we announced dotnet try a global tool which allows developers to create interactive workshops and documentation. Tutorials created with dotnet try let users start learning without having to install an editor. Features like IntelliSense and live diagnostics give users a sophisticated learning and editing experience. Today, we are releasing a new dotnet new template called trydotnet-tutorial. This template can be installed next to existing dotnet new templates. It creates a project and associated files to help content authors understand the basics of dotnet try. This can serve as the foundation of your own awesome documentation!
