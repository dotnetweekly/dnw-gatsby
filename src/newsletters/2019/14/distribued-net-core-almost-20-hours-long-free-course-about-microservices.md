With a friend of mine, we've created a free course (almost 20 hours) about building Microservices with .NET Core named "Distributed .NET Core". Everything started a year ago, at first we put all of the code on GitHub into a separate organization (https://github.com/devmentors/DNC-DShop) and then, a few months later we decided to record videos about these topics.

In total we recorded 15 episodes and put them on YouTube, everything is to be shared with the community :).

We also managed to build a small community around this project (both on Gitter and Forums).
