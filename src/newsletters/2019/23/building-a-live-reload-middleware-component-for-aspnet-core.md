In my last post I discussed how to integrate Live Reload in ASP.NET Core using a third party NodeJs application loaded from NPM called BrowserSync. While that works just fine, having to run yet another command line utility on top of dotnet watch run just to provide Live Reload functionality is a bit of a pain.
