Welcome to this short introduction to Blazor! This new Microsoft framework uses a unique approach to leverage your existing C# and .NET skills to create single-page applications running in web browsers. The technology that makes this possible is called WebAssembly, an open standard supported directly by current browsers on desktop and mobile platforms. You write C# and Razor code instead of JavaScript, and the compiled app runs natively on the client.
