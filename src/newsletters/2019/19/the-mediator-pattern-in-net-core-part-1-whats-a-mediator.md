A couple of years back, I had to help out on a project that was built entirely using the “Mediator Pattern”. Or more specifically, built entirely using the MediatR library. There were all these presentations about the “theory” behind the Mediator Pattern and how it was a real new way of thinking. I couldn’t help but think… We’ve been doing this for years. Except we just call it good programming… Infact I had my own pattern which we’ll look into in Part 2 that I called the “IEnumerable Pattern” which achieved the same thing.
