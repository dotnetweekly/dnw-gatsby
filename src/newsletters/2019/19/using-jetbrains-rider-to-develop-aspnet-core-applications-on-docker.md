Containers have been around for a long timeâ€”I remember running a PHP application in a Linux container somewhere around 2004. But ever since Docker came into existence in 2012-2014, containers took off big time. And when .NET Core came about in 2016, all of a sudden, C# Web applications can run in a containerized environment as well!
