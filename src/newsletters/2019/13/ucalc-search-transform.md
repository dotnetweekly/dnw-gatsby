1. Say goodbye to the limited Ctrl-F way of searching your code. 
2. uCalc's innovative approach to refactoring puts you in the driver's seat, letting you transform code just the way you want, with unprecedented power and ease.

The uCalc Search/Transform extension for Visual Studio takes search and refactoring to a new level.
Why search for just one thing at a time, when you can find as many things as you want simultaneously?

Gone are the days of old fashioned Ctrl-F type searches that limited you to words and phrases, or complicated regex patterns that still couldn't capture everything you wanted. Check out intuitive uCalc patterns. Just combine tokens (words/symbols) and parameters (which capture everything up to the next anchor token or delimiter).
