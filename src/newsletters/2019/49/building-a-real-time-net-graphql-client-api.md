We are busy, busy, busy working on version 11 of Hot Chocolate and Strawberry Shake.

In this post I want to explore the client side of GraphQL on .NET more with a special emphasis on subscriptions.

Since, with the new version of Strawberry Shake our initial blog has become kind of invalid I also will walk you trough the basics again before heading into subscriptions and what lies beyond.
