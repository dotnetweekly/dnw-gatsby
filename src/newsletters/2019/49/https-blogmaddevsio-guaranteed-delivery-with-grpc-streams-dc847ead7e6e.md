Let’s take a look at the minimum requirements for web developers in the 2000s. In the good old days, you could build more or less working website with a backend programming language (e.g PHP, Python, Ruby), some Javascript + jQuery and the ability to create an HTML layout from PSD. That’s all. The code was deployed mainly by FTP. CI/CD, Pipelines, DevOps, SRE and other mainstream concepts were not in the list of minimum requirements for web developers.
