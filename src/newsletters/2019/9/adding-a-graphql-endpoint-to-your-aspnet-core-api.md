In this pic there is a consumer of the API that can be any kind of application. The consumer sends a query to the API. Part one what GraphQL specifies is the format and syntax of the query. Part two is a runtime on the API that is able to process the query. When the runtime has processed the query it typically returns JSON, but that is not set in stone by the specification.
