Regular readers of this column will know that I do a lot of work with Entity Framework (EF) and the newer EF Core, and that also Iâ€™m a big fan of Azure Cosmos DB. At first glance, you might think that an Object Relational Mapper (ORM) and a document database such as Cosmos DB would have nothing to do with one another. ORMs are designed to solve the problem of mapping objects to relational databases. With a document database or other type of NoSQL databases, you can just store objects and graphs of objects as JSON and not have to worry about the constraints of a relational database. So why would I, or the EF team or other developers be putting the two together?
