In the battle over cloud providers, the bid for the United States Department of Defense (DoD) Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) contract is a big deal. The DoD released on October 25, 2019 that they are awarding the JEDI contract worth up-to $10 Billion ($10,000,000,000) over the next 10 years to Microsoft. They have ultimately chosen Microsoft, and Microsoft Azure, as the cloud of choice to standardize on a single cloud vendor to build out their enterprise cloud.
