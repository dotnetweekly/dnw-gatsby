Convey is a set of helper libraries that can be used independently of each other to help you to build your web applications and microservices, yet it is neither a framework nor a silver bullet. Convey does provide utilities to tackle challenges such as messaging, service discovery, load balancing, secure configuration, monitoring, distributed tracing and many more.
