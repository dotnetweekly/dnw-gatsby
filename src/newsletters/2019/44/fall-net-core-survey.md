It’s been a busy time for .NET Core – we just shipped 3.0, and are currently working on a few updates for v3.1 (due in November.) As we turn our attention to .NET Core 5.0, we want to take a step back and see what you are doing with .NET Core and how we can make it even better.

We have put together a quick survey that will help us understand our customer base a bit better, how you are using .NET core, and what we can do to improve it. So please head over to Survey Monkey and help shape the future of .NET Core.

Surveys help give us a breadth view of .NET Core users, but we also want to understand in more depth what challenges you face in your projects, so if you are willing to participate in more detailed feedback, please provide your contact details in the survey.

Thank you for your contribution.
