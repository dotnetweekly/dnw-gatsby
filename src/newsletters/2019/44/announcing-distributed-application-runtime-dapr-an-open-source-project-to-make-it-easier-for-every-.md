It is remarkable to see the transformation over the last few years as more and more developers build scalable, cloud native applications, taking advantage of managed services to deploy and run them. With this transformation, microservice architectures have become the standard for building cloud native applications, and it is predicted that by 2022, 90% of new apps will feature microservice architectures. A microservice architecture offers compelling benefits, including scalability, loose service coupling and independent deployments. However, this approach can come at a high cost of understanding and skilling on distributed systems.
