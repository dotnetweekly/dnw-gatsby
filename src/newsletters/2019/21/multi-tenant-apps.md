When building a application that simply serves a bunch of users, you can make a lot of assumptions. You might assume that they can share a certain amount of data, interact in certain ways, and use certain features of the application. However, if your clients are businesses or other organizations, you’ll quickly find that those organizations want to have their own little areas in your application and only want their users to interact with each other. Further, they are going to want assurances that their sensitive data is not going to be shared. It gets even more fun if any part of the system is exposed to your client’s clients.
