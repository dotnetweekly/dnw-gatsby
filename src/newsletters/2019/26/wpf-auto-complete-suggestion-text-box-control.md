A good product requires good user interaction. Products that are using search boxes will be expected to have auto-completion/suggestion feature. In WPF platform, the default text box control does not have any built-in auto-completion/suggestion feature. There are many 3rd party libraries out there which provide auto-complete/suggestion text box control as a replacement to the default WPF text box control. Most of these libraries are available in the paid version and those which are available for free, are difficult to get integrated with your existing code. So, I have created a very simple AutoComplete/Suggestion control for WPF platform without using any external library.
