I recently wrote 3 blog posts ([1] [2] [3]) on different Producer/Consumer (Job Queues) implementations. There are a lot of great different ways to implement Job Queues in C#, but which to choose? Which one is better, faster and more versatile?

In this article, I want to get to the point where you can make a confident decision on which implementation to choose. That means checking performance and comparing customization options.
