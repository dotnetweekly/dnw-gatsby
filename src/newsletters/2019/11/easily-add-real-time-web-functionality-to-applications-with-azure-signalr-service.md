Hi, folks. Today I wanted to chat with you about real-time web functionality. Normally when we think of the web, we think of a mostly passive experience. When you bring up your mail web client and leave it for a while, your mail gets stale. You won’t get your recent emails until you refresh the page, or, if you’re lucky, your client has a timer that automatically refreshes the page for you. But it doesn’t have to be this way. SignalR is a technology that can push new emails to you as soon as they arrive. Using SignalR, you can even have a real-time, two-way conversation with someone over the web. And with Azure SignalR Service">, you get a fully managed service that helps you build real-time experiences such as chat, stock tickers, live whiteboard, and more.
