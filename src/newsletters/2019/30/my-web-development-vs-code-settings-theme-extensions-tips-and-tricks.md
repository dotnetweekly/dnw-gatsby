I have been using a lot of editors and IDE's since I began programming.
Eclipse, Netbeans, Notepade++, Brackets Editor, Sublime Text 2, Sublime Text 3, Webstorm, Atom Editor and probably some more I forgot.

Currently, I'm using Visual Studio Code. According to google trends, it is also the most searched editor. There are some excellent reasons for that.

vs code feels fast. It is tough to get vs code to slow down. Usually, it is not the fault of vs code but a poorly implemented extension.

File search is super fast. It feels instant. Like there is no wait time.

It is lightweight but also has most of the things you need pre-installed. Search files, debugging, basic git GUI.

Nice theme support and customization support. You can pretty much change everything in vs code.

Excellent extensions! Think of an extension you need? Yeah vs code has that!
