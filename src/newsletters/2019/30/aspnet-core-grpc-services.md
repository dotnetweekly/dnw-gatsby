Originally developed at Google, gRPC today is a remote procedure call (RPC) framework that has emerged as an alternative to RESTful and HTTP-based interfaces to connect remote components and specifically microservices. The new RPC framework was created in part to work with modern technologies such as HTTP/2 and Protobuf.
