In continuation with our announcement of SQL Server 2019 release candidate last week, we’re announcing that the release candidate refresh for SQL Server 2019 is now available to download. The release candidate now includes bits for Big Data Clusters in SQL Server 2019 in this refresh.

Back in July, we announced the preview of Big Data Clusters in SQL Server 2019 and since then we’ve seen our customers actively bringing their big data analytical workloads to SQL Server 2019 to operationalize their AI and machine learning projects.
