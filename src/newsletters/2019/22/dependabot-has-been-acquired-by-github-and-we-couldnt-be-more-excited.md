Here's what you need to know:

We're integrating Dependabot directly into GitHub, starting with security fix PRs
You can still install Dependabot from the GitHub Marketplace whilst we integrate it into GitHub, but it's now free of charge
We've doubled the size of Dependabot's team; expect lots of great improvements over the coming months
