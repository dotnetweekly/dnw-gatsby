Earlier I posted about creating First ASP.NET Core 3.0 App using Visual Studio 2019 Preview 1 release. ASP.NET Core 3.0 is a major release and has some code breaking changes. However, .NET Core 3.0 preview 1 release didn’t offer any insight of the new features. Recently, .NET Core 3.0 preview 2 came out and now we can get a feel of ASP.NET Core 3.0 new features. In this post, let’s create a new ASP.NET Core 3.0 app with .NET Core 3.0 preview 2 release and take a look at the new features.
