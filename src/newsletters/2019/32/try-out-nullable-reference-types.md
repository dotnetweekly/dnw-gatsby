With the release of .NET Core 3.0 Preview 7, C# 8.0 is considered "feature complete". That means that the biggest feature of them all, Nullable Reference Types, is also locked down behavior-wise for the .NET Core release. It will continue to improve after C# 8.0, but it is now considered stable with the rest of C# 8.0.

At this time, our aim is to collect as much feedback about the process of adopting nullability as possible, catch any issues, and collect feedback on further improvements to the feature that we can do after .NET Core 3.0. This is one of the largest features ever built for C#, and although we’ve done our best to get things right, we need your help!

It is at this junction that we especially call upon .NET library authors to try out the feature and begin annotating your libraries. We’d love to hear your feedback and help resolve any issues you come across.
