In this article we'll look into when it's helpful to use a code-behind in your Blazor development, how we benefit and what to expect when re-factoring existing components.

When working with Blazor the default component architecture is to have all of the markup and logic mixed within a single file (.razor). When components are simple this approach works well, however as the complexity becomes greater managing the entirety of a component as a whole becomes difficult. Using a "code-behind" approach allows for markup and logic to be separated into their own files. In this article we'll look into when it's helpful to use a code-behind, how we benefit and what to expect when re-factoring existing components.
