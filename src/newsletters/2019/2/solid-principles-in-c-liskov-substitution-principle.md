The Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) states that child class objects should be able to replace a parent class objects without compromising the application integrity. What this means essentially, is that we should put an effort to create such derived class objects which can replace objects of the base class without modifying its behavior. If we don’t, our application might end up being broken.
