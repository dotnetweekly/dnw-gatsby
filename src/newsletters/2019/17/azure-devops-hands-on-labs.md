These labs will generate fully functional samples in your own workspace.  This allows for a few things I think are important:

You don’t mess up your own projects.
You have your own copy of the demo that you can mess up and recreate at any time.
Since you have it in your own workspace you can test our scenarios as much as you want.
If want to demonstrate technologies to others (internal or external) it’s a great place for you to start your demo.
