TLDR: You can create PWAs using the .NET Blazor framework. A sample is here and the code is on GitHub.

Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) are one of the current trends in the web world. They make it possible to install web apps on the device which does not only make your websites work offline but also provides features like push notifications. Sites like Twitter are already jumping on the PWA train and with Google, Microsoft, Apple and Firefox all major browser and operating system vendors are actively working on supporting the standard. Microsoft even adds PWAs to their Microsoft Store with Twitter being one of the first available PWA there, replacing the old UWP version.
