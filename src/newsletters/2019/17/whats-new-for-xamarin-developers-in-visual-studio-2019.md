Visual Studio 2019 is the next major version of Visual Studio which is now generally available (GA)! With this version, there is a lot to love. From a real-time collaboration with colleagues using Visual Studio Live Share to the new Visual Studio start window as well as delights like per-monitor DPI support and improved debug capabilities. We believe this is the best release of Visual Studio yet!
