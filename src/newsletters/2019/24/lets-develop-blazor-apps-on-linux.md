Blazor is one of fantastic technologies I think.

It will be shipped a part of .NET Core 3.0.

 

It can build client side web apps using C#, however it run on web standard like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, WebAssembly and more. I remembered Silverlight that has similar development experience, I liked it, but Blazor is different that is using 100% open web standard technologies.

 

There are two different models:

Server-side Blazor
This runs on server-side through SignalR.
Client-side Blazor
This runs on browser using WebAssembly.
However, you can create apps on same programming model.

Of course, it is .NET Core, so you can create Blazor apps on Linux too.
