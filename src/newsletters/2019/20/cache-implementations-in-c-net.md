One of the most commonly used patterns in software development is Caching. Itâ€™s a simple, but a very effective concept. The idea is to reuse operation results. When performing a heavy operation, we will save the result in our cache container. The next time that we need that result, we will pull it from the cache container, instead of performing the heavy operation again.
