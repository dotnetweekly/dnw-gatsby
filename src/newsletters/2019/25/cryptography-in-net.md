Cryptography is a very important thing for information security. Information security is composed of 4 parts:

Integrity: ensure a document is not altered
Confidentiality: ensure only authorized people can read a document
Authentication: ensure the document was written by an identified person
Non-Repudiation: prove who/where a document came from as well as the authenticity of that message, so the sender cannot deny they have sent it
Let's see what .NET provides for each part!
