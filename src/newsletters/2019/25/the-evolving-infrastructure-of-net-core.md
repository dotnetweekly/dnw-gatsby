With .NET Core 3.0 Preview 6 out the door, we thought it would be useful to take a brief look at the history of our infrastructure systems and the significant improvements that have been made in the last year or so.

This post will be interesting if you are interested in build infrastructure or want a behind-the-scenes look at how we build a product as big as .NET Core. It doesnâ€™t describe new features or sample code that you should use in your next application. Please tell us if you like these types of posts. We have a few more like this planned, but would appreciate knowing if you find this type of information helpful.
