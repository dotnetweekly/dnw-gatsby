Almost any website you visit today is protected by HTTPS. If yours isn’t yet, it should be. Securing your server with HTTPS also means that you can’t send requests to this server from one that isn’t protected by HTTPS. This poses a problem for developers who use a local development environment because all of them run on http://localhost out-of-the-box.
