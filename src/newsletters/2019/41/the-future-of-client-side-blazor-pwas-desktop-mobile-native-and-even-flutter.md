The development of client-side Blazor leveraging WebAssembly -- appropriately called Blazor WebAssembly -- has suffered a few hiccups, but Microsoft has big plans for the red-hot technology that enables C# Web development.

As detailed in a .NET Conf presentation this week, those plans include more native-focused projects, including Progressive Web Apps (PWAs), hybrid apps and desktop apps via Electron. The company is also investigating Blazor Native -- and there's even an individual experiment demo that uses Blazor to create Flutter apps. These are all possible because the default renderer in Blazor -- for Web -- can be replaced with other renderers.
