This is the seventh article in our series about building microservices on .NET Core. In the first article we introduced the series and prepared the plan: business case and solution architecture. In the second article we described how you can structure internal architecture of one microservice using CQRS pattern and MediatR library. In the third article we described the importance of service discovery in microservice based architecture and presented practical implementation with Eureka. In the fourth part we presented how you can build API Gateways for your microservices with Ocelot. Fifth part was dedicated to implementation of data access with Marten library. In the last article we showed you how you can combine SignalR and RabbitMQ to build real time server-client communication. Source code for complete solution can be found on our GitHub.
