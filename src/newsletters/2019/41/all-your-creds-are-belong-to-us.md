In my last blog I explained how your pa$word doesn’t matter - but multi-factor authentication (MFA) does! Several folks commented that “MFA isn’t a panacea.” That’s true in targeted attacks when attackers are willing to invest enough to break MFA, and there’s no easier way.

Let’s not get crazy - Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) is the least you can do if you are at all serious about protecting your accounts. Use of anything beyond the password significantly increases the costs for attackers, which is why the rate of compromise of accounts using any type of MFA is less than 0.1% of the general population.
