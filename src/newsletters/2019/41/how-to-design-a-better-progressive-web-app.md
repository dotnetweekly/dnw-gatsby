Sometimes it’s hard to tell when the newest web design trend will be worth adopting or when it’s just a passing fad we shouldn’t invest too much time or energy in. Progressive web apps (PWAs), for instance, had that problem in the beginning, which is why most content written about them focused on explaining what they were.

Today, though, we don’t need to be educated on what a PWA is or why it’s a more valuable mobile asset than a mobile responsive website.

PWAs are inherently fast and secure. Plus, they’re a great option for anyone who wants to leverage the good stuff from native mobile apps (like offline caching and telephony integrations) while improving upon their weaknesses (like battery and storage consumption and sharing capabilities).
