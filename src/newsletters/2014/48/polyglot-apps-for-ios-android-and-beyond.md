It's well known by now that you can use C# to write apps for iOS and Android by leveraging Xamarin tools, especially if you've been following this column. It's also well documented that you can take a lot of that C# over to other platforms such as Windows Phone and Windows Store, but did you know you can use F#, Visual Basic, Razor, HTML, and JavaScript in your apps, as well?
