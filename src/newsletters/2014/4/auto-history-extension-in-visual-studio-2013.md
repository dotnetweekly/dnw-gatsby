Have you ever found yourself wishing you could roll back a few hours to a piece of code you had working but have made changes to? You were “in the flow” and you haven’t checked anything in to your source control system (or perhaps weren’t using source code control on your project)? We are pleased to announce the availability of an early preview of an extension on the Visual Studio Gallery to give you automatic, no-configuration history tracking for your local machine. Just install the extension, and whatever you do to your projects and solutions, it silently and efficiently tracks the changes you make to any files that you have opened in the Visual Studio Editor. Then, when you find yourself in need of back-tracking to an earlier version of one or more of your files, you can find your way back to it.
