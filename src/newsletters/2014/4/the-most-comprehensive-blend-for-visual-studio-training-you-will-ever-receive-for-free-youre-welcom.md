November 2013, immediately after the release of Visual Studio 2013, I sat down for an all-day session with Unni Ravindranathan, the Senior Program Manager for Blend. Who better to walk through, not the new features of Blend, but all the core features of Blend – and the new features, too. In some cases, Blend for Visual Studio 2013 returned some of the features removed in Blend for Visual Studio 2012. But in many cases, it’s just candy tooling for the XAML developer.
