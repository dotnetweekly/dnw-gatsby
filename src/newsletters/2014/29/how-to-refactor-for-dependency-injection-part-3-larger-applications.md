Dependency injection is a programming paradigm that enables you to write much more maintainable code by promoting loose coupling of objects. (In case you've missed them, this article is a continuation of Part 1 and Part 2 in my series on dependency injection. ) In a new or small application, refactoring to dependency injection is relatively straight forward. As the application to be refactored grows larger, however, it can become quite the undertaking. Fortunately, there's a way to simplify the problem and refactor your application piece by piece.
