We're continuing with our Visual Studio Extension Monday series today, with an extension that I came across this week. Today's extension is by Steve Cadwallader and even though it's only officially v0.7.0, it's still very complete and feature rich. And of course, the source for it is available too! Looking for a little help understanding your code? Looking for a little help formatting or reorganizing your code? Looking for a little help cleaning up your code? Then you might be looking for..<a href="http://www.codemaid.net/" target="_blank">CodeMaid</a>
