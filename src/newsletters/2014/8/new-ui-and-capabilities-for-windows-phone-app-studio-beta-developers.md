We created Windows Phone App Studio Beta as a powerful but easy-to-use tool to help hobbyists, enthusiasts and new developers create content-based apps from end to end, all within a web UI.

To date 350,000 developers of all skill levels have used Windows Phone App Studio Beta, resulting in 300,000 projects and 20,000 apps published to Windows Phone Store. We look forward to more. And we thank you for all the great suggestions youâ€™ve made along the way.
