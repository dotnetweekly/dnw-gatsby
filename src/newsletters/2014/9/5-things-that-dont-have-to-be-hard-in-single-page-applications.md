Last week I came across a Blog post by Sourcegraph's Quinn Slack on 5 painful things about client-side JS or single page web applications. As I read Quinn's points and comments I could not help but think yes he is right, but wrong at the same time. I think he originally titled the article with Angular in the the title, which lit a fire under the framework's apologist, making him change the title. I have opinions about Angular and the other popular MV* frameworks, but I will reserve that for another post or three.
