In a previous <a href="http://blogs.windows.com/windows/b/appbuilder/archive/2013/08/20/creating-smarter-apps-with-geofencing.aspx" target="_blank">blog post</a>, we talked about how to use geofences to make your apps smarter and more useful by having them respond to changes in the user’s location. With geofencing, your apps can do things like remind the user to pick up some milk when he or she is near a grocery store, or present a coupon for a nearby shop. The geofencing features in Windows 8.1 do this for you in an intelligent and power-efficient manner. This blog post complements the previous post by discussing how to test and debug your geofencing apps. Because geofencing depends on a device’s location, we’ll present you with a variety of techniques for verifying that your app is working correctly before you submit it to the Windows Store.
