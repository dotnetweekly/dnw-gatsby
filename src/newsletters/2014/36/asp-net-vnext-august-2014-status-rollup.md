Work on the <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/IntroducingASPNETVNext.aspx">next version of ASP.NET</a> continues. It's a world of Alpha software, Git commits, breaking changes, and daily builds. If you're not one for risk, this blog post is for you. Read about all the fun stuff that's going on, and install nothing. If you do like a little spice in your life, jump in and install some early builds and join this active and opinionated community.
