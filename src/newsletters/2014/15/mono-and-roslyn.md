Roslyn is an effort to create a new generation of compilers written in managed code. In addition to the standard batch compiler, it contains a compiler API that can be used by all kinds of tools that want to understand and manipulate C# source code. I had the honor of sharing the stage with Anders Hejlsberg when he published the source code, and showed both Roslyn working on a Mac with Mono, as well as showing the very same patch that he demoed on stage running on Mono.
