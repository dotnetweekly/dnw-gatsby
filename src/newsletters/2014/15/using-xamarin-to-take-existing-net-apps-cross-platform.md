This is the last of a four part series on building cross platform apps using Xamarin and C#. In this episode Robert is joined byÂ <a href="http://www.twitter.com/JamesMontemagno">James Montemagno</a>, a developer evangelist at <a href="http://www.xamarin.com/">Xamarin</a>, who discusses how to mobilize an existing .NET Silverlight app by reusing the existing C# code on Android, iOS, and Windows Phone. We will see how the Xamarin .NET Mobility Scanner and Portable Class Libraries can be leveraged for easy mobilization of the app and maximum code reuse between all platforms.
