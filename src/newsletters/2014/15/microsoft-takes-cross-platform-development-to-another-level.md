The concept of "write once, run anywhere" has long been a dream of developers. Supporting an application across multiple platforms and devices, without having to rewrite and maintain it, is something of a Holy Grail for the developer community.

That dream came a lot closer to reality today, at least on the Windows platform. During the Day 1 Build keynote in San Francisco, Microsoft announced "universal Windows apps," which uses the Windows Runtime to build apps that will run on Windows Phone 8.1, Windows 8.1 and even Xbox One.
