If you're an app developer who wants to design and build Windows Phone 8.1 apps using XAML and C#, don't miss this exciting event. The two-and-a-half day, demo-rich course, taught by experts who have years of experience developing (and writing about the process), focuses on how to create apps for Windows Phone 8.1 in Visual Studio and how to create universal app projects that share a high percentage of code and that target both Windows and Windows Phone.
