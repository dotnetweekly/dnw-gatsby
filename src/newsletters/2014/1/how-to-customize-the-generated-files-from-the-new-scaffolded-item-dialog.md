In Visual Studio 2013 we introduced the Add New Scaffolded Item dialog. This dialog replaced the Add View/Add Controllers ASP.NET MVC dialog which was had in 2012. This new dialog works for all ASP.NET projects (MVC, Web Forms and Web API). This is one example of how we are delivering on the “One ASP.NET” vision. We’ve also released the same support for Visual Studio 2012, checkout our previous post at <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/webdev/archive/2013/11/18/announcing-release-of-asp-net-and-web-tools-2013-1-for-visual-studio-2012.aspx">http://blogs.msdn.com/b/webdev/archive/2013/11/18/announcing-release-of-asp-net-and-web-tools-2013-1-for-visual-studio-2012.aspx</a> for more info on how to get started in VS2012 with the new features.
