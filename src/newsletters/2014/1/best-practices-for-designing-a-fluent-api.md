In my previous column, "<a href="http://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2013/11/01/when-to-build-fluent-interfaces-for-re-use-and-clarity.aspx" target="_blank">When to Build Fluent Interfaces for Re-Use and Clarity</a>," I discussed the design considerations that I would take into account in deciding to build a fluent API. While I appreciate the readability that a fluent interface provides, before deciding to undertake the extra work that implementing a fluent API requires, I look for methods and properties that aren't trivial to implement (so that I save developers time by providing them) and that can be applied to a variety of classes that don't share a common ancestor.
