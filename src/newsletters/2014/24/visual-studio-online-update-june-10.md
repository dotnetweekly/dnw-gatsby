It’s time for our <a href="http://www.visualstudio.com/news/2014-jun-10-vso">sprint 66 deployment</a> already!  Over the next couple of days the update will be rolling out across accounts.  The big news in this update is <strong>Pull Requests</strong> for Git repos.  Pull requests are a workflow often used with Git whereby a developer makes some changes in a private branch.  They then submit a “pull request” with is essentially a request for changes checked into that branch to be merged into another branch by the “owner” (or a committer in Git speak) of the target branch.  That workflow enables a code review experience with back and forth discussions of the changes, refinements if the changes need updates, etc.  Ultimately the pull request is either accepted and merged into the target branch or rejected.
