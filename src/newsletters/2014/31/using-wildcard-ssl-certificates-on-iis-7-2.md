I was assisting someone recently who was trying to setup a wildcard certificate on their Windows VPS. Their server was running Windows Server 2008 R2 with IIS 7.5. They had enough technical savvy to configure their own sites with IIS Manger and install  SSL certificates. However, they hit road block trying to get their new wildcard certificate properly installed on multiple sites.
