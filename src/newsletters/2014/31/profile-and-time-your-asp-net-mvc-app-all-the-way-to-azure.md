Successful web app dev teams generally consider performance a requirement from the beginning,Â  not an afterthought. Performance should be considered in all phases of a project, from design and into production, including updates to the app. That's not to say you should try to optimize code before you've measured it, you really don't know what needs to be optimized until you measure perf. This tutorial will primarily use a modified version of Tom Dykstra's <a href="http://www.asp.net/mvc/tutorials/getting-started-with-ef-using-mvc/creating-an-entity-framework-data-model-for-an-asp-net-mvc-application">EF6/MVC 5 Contoso University app </a> to introduce you to measuring and monitoring performance.
