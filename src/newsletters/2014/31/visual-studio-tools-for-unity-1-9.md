Today we released the Visual Studio Tools for Unity add-on (formerly known as UnityVS). VSTU is Microsoft’s free Visual Studio add-on that enables a rich programming and debugging experience for working with the <a href="http://unity3d.com/">Unity gaming tools and platform</a>. This is our first release since <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/somasegar/archive/2014/07/02/microsoft-acquires-syntaxtree-creator-of-unityvs-plugin-for-visual-studio.aspx">the acquisition of SyntaxTree</a>, and we’re excited to have the opportunity to reach to the Unity community with Visual Studio.
