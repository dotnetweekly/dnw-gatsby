Hi, this is Jeffrey Richter. I was very excited when Microsoft announced universal apps for Windows Store and Windows Phone apps. One reason is that I can now use my existing C#/CLR/WinRT skill set to build phone apps. Another reason is because it means my <a href="https://www.microsoftpressstore.com/store/windows-runtime-via-c-sharp-9780735679276"><i>Windows Runtime via C# </i>book</a> now has a new audience. In fact, the book’s content is entirely applicable for Windows Phone 8.1 developers except for the few differences described in <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/microsoft_press/archive/2014/07/16/windows-phone-updates-for-windows-runtime-via-c.aspx">this earlier blog post, “Windows Phone updates for Windows Runtime via C#.”</a> I’ve already converted all the book’s code samples to universal apps, and I have them running on both Windows and Windows Phone. You can download this code from <a href="https://www.microsoftpressstore.com/store/windows-runtime-via-c-sharp-9780735679276">the book’s catalog page in the new Microsoft Press Store</a> (via the Downloads tab).
