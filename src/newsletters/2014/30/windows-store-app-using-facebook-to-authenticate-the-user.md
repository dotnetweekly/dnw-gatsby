In this video, Gianluca Bertelli, an Escalation Engineer from Italy, will show you how to integrate Facebook within our Windows Store Applications – Using the class WebAuthenticationBroker to authenticate the users with any authentication provider that uses Oauth2 as protocol.  You will see how to create an application that emulates a Single Sign On. The last topic covered is how to deal with the token that is returned by Facebook, how to store and reuse it later.
