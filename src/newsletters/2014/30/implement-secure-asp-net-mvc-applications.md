When you implement security in web applications, you will need to think about a lot of security details. Some of the standard features you will need to implement are:
<ol>
	<li>Authentication of the user</li>
	<li>Page access control where you can decide what pages the user can open depending on his role or access rights</li>
	<li>Preventing security attacks</li>
</ol>
In this article, I will discuss some security elements and show you how they can be implemented in MVC applications.
