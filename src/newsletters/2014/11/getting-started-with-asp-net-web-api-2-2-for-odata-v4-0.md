A few weeks ago we started publishing nightly builds for our initial support in ASP.NET Web API for the OData v4.0 protocol. Our OData v4.0 support is based on the OData Library for OData v4.0 that has been released in the past few months. The OData v4.0 protocol introduces a lot of changes and new features that allow more flexibility in the way to model services and improvements over many features from the past versions of the protocol.
