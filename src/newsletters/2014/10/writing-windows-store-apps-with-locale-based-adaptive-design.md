The Windows architecture allows developers to create apps and easily make then available to people all around the globe. This process, known as <i><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh465006.aspx" target="_blank">globalization</a></i>, requires that developers primarily design an app with culturally-neutral behavior. Windows Store apps use the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.globalization.aspx" target="_blank">Globalization namespace</a> to address these needs. In this namespace, you’ll find all the core APIs that allow an app to manage, define, detect and convert all international elements (e.g.: formats for date, time, decimals, currencies, regions, languages, etc.) supported by any Windows machine, regardless of the user’s profile.
