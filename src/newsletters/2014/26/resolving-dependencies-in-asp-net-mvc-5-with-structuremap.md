In a previous post I showed how to use <a href="http://ardalis.com/How-Do-I-Use-StructureMap-with-ASP.NET-MVC-3">StructureMap with ASP.NET MVC 3</a>.  It’s been a couple of years, so I figured it was time to update that article with the steps for getting StructureMap working in ASP.NET MVC 5.  If you’re interested in learning more about how to develop applications in a loosely coupled fashion, I highly recommend my <a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/training/Courses/TableOfContents/principles-oo-design">course on SOLID Principles of Object Oriented Design</a> to learn more (in particular, the <a href="http://deviq.com/dependency-inversion-principle">Dependency Inversion Principle</a>).
