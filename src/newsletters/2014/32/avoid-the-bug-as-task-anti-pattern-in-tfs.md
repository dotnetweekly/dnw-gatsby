For the last few months I have been working with a large financial customer in the Netherlands that has been steadily adopting Work Item Tracking in TFS. I have learned that you should avoid the Bug as a Task anti-pattern. The customer that I have been working with is fairly large and there are quite a few ALM Consultants helping them out. My task was to on board one business line of about 120 people and ~10 teams. Incidentally, these teams are, for the most part, Java teams. As with any enterprise there are things that departments can decide for themselves and things that are handed down from on high. In this particular company they are fond of ‘laterals’. A ‘lateral’ is a group of people who get together to make arbitrary and unilateral decisions about how a process should be implemented. The problem arises when they start prescribing the “how” and not just the “what”. They start making technology decision oh “how” things should be implemented, not nessesarily understanding the ramifications. I call this ‘educated ignorance’.
