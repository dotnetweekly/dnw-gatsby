Now that Entity Framework is open source, the development community is able to contribute code to it at entityframework.codeplex.com. But don’t limit yourself to looking there for tools and extensions. There are other great tools, both commercial and community-driven, that can help you achieve more with Entity Framework. In this column, I want to highlight some of those tools and extensions that come from the community. They’re all free and available through the Visual Studio Gallery (for IDE extensions) or NuGet (for code libraries). There are even some from members of the Entity Framework team that are pet projects and external to the official bits.
