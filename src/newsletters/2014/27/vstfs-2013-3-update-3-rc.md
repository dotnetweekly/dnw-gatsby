Today we are releasing Visual Studio 2013 and Team Foundation Server 2013 Update 3. This is a “go-live” release and is expected to be the last preview before Update 3 is released.  It will be supported in production, can be used to upgrade production environments and will support upgrades to the final version when it is available.  We expect the final release to be within the next month or two.
