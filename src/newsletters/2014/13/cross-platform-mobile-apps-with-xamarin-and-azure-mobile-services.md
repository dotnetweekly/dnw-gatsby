This is the third of a four part series on building cross platform apps using Xamarin and C#. In this episode Robert is joined by <a href="http://www.twitter.com/JamesMontemagno" target="_blank">James Montemagno</a>, a developer evangelist at <a href="http://www.xamarin.com/" target="_blank">Xamarin</a>, who discusses how to leverage Azure Mobile Services and Xamarin to transform an offline app to a cloud connected cross-platform mobile app. We will integrate oAuth into our application to store our data on a per user basis, all of which will be shared using the same C# code across Android, iOS, and Windows from one Portable Class Library.
