The C# Language Specification does not define a coding standard. However, the guidelines in this topic are used by Microsoft to develop samples and documentation.
Coding conventions serve the following purposes:
- They create a consistent look to the code, so that readers can focus on content, not layout.
- They enable readers to understand the code more quickly by making assumptions based on previous experience.
- They facilitate copying, changing, and maintaining the code.
- They demonstrate C# best practices.
