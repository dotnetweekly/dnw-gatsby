Microsoft Azure provides a perfect solution for those with a subscription (BizSpark, MSDN etc.) to test out the previews of various software. I can immediately think of Visual Studio 2015 Preview and Windows 10 Technical Preview. If you don’t want to download the iso’s or don’t want to set up your own VM to test them on, Microsoft Azure is the way you want to go.
