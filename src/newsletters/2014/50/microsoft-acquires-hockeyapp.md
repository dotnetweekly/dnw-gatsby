I’m excited to announce our acquisition of <a style="color: #707070" href="http://hockeyapp.net/features/">HockeyApp</a><span style="color: #424242"> – the next step in our journey to turn </span><a style="color: #707070" href="http://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/explore/application-insights-vs.aspx">Application Insights</a> into the best tool in the world for helping you get insight into your applications.  With HockeyApp we add great support for mobile devices, allowing you see more of your application and helping you answer: 1) Is my application available/reliable? 2) Is my application performing? 3) Is my application succeeding – allowing my users to accomplish what they intend and delivering on my business goals?
