<a href="http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/a1166718-a2d9-4a48-a5fd-504ff4ad1b65">Bing Developer Assistant for Visual Studio</a>Â combines the functionality of two popular Visual Studio extensions into one: Sample Browser and Bing Code Search. In this episode, Robert is joined by Yi Wei and Scott Ge, who show how developers can use this extension to find and reuse millions of code snippets and code sample projects from within the Visual Studio IDE. They focus on 3 new features: integration with IntelliSense, how the Sample Browser window provides a one-stop shop for samples and the ability to search offline.
