By the time you read this, Build—the Microsoft developer conference—will be over and developers will be thinking about how to respond to all that was presented: embrace immediately, watch with slight trepidation or ignore for the moment. For .NET/C# developers, the most significant announcement was undoubtedly the release of the next version of the C# compiler (“Roslyn”) as open source. Related to that are the language improvements themselves. Even if you don’t have plans to immediately adopt C# vNext—which I’ll refer to henceforth and unofficially as C# 6.0—at a minimum, you should be aware of its features and take note of those that might make it worth jumping right in.
