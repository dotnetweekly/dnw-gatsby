Twitter Bootstrap (TWB) is a free front-end framework built by Twitter developers to ensure visual and functional consistency across websites and applications. In Twitter Bootstrap Succinctly, Peter Shaw walks you through the basics of using TWB Version 2 CSS classes to add beautiful, user-friendly components to your projects. You'll learn how to add TWB to an existing project, and use it to customize attractive buttons, tabs, breadcrumbs, dropdowns, and more. There are even chapters dedicated to optional JavaScript and TWB extensions for when you're ready to take your UI's appearance a step further.
