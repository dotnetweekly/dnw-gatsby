Prism provides guidance in the form of samples and documentation that help you easily design and build rich, flexible, and easily maintained Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) desktop applications. Using design patterns that embody important architectural design principles, such as separation of concerns and loose coupling, Prism helps you to design and build applications using loosely coupled components that can evolve independently but which can be easily and seamlessly integrated into the overall application. In short, these applications are "built to last" and "built for change." These types of applications are known as composite applications.
This topic provides a brief overview of the Prism concepts with links to associated source code and documentation. If you are considering upgrading from Prism 4.1 to Prism 5.0 we include a "Whatâ€™s New" and "Upgrading from Prism 4.1" topic that you should read.
