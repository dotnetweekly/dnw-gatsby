At TechEd North America we were excited to announce our plans for EF7, and even demo some very early features. This post will cover the announcements we made during the session. You can also watch the recorded session from TechEd (the EF7 content starts at <span style="background-color: #ffffff"><strong>46:40</strong></span>). When watching the demos please bear in mind that this is a very early preview - not all the features shown are even submitted into the main code base yet.
