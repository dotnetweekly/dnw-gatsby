Most of the modern programming languages including C# support objected oriented programming. Features such as encapsulation, inheritance, overloading and polymorphism are code level features. Using these features is just one part of the story. Equally important is to apply some object oriented design principles while writing your C# code. SOLID principles is a set of five such principles--namely Single Responsibility Principle, Open/Closed Principle, Liskov Substitution Principle, Interface Segregation Principle and Dependency Inversion Principle. Applying these time proven principles make your code structured, neat and easy to maintain. This article discusses SOLID principles and also illustrates how they can be applied to your C# code.
