With widespread access to broadband Internet and wireless devices, there’s considerable demand for real-time apps. Popular sites such as Facebook and Twitter, multiplayer games and collaborative business apps have the best UX when they’re live, real-time apps. Many other types of apps are great candidates for real-time experiences, such as stock and finance apps, auctions, sales dashboards, e-commerce and educational apps. Even Web sites and apps where live data isn’t a necessity can benefit from real-time, full duplex communications with SignalR.
