For my entire programming life, reusable code and reusable data have been a driving objective. So, when I began learning about Domain-Driven Design (DDD), I struggled with its guidance to enforce such separation across its bounded contexts that the result might be duplicated code and even duplicated data. I had a small fit when some of the best minds in the DDD world attempted an intervention to help me see the potential pitfalls of my old ways. Finally, Eric Evans explained that one had to choose where to pay the price of complexity. Because DDD is about reducing complexity in the software, the outcome is that you pay a price with respect to maintaining duplicate models and possibly duplicate data.
