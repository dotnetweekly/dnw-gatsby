Starting with Visual Studio 2013 (with update 2), developers can create an app with a single solution to target multiple devices such as PCs, tablets, or phones.  This type of solution can generate universal Windows apps.  These can be written with C#, C++, or JavaScript. For video training on the topic, please check out the free course at the Microsoft Virtual Academy.
