In a previous post, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/kaevans/archive/2014/04/09/using-portable-class-libraries-to-reuse-models-and-viewmodels.aspx">Using Portable Class Libraries to Reuse Models and ViewModels</a>, I showed an example of creating a portable class library (PCL) and how to use it with several types of clients (WPF, Windows 8, and Windows Phone).Â  This post is going to show how to reuse the same PCL library to create an app for Android with Visual Studio 2013 and Xamarin.Android.
