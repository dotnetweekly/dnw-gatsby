Goal of a load testing activity is to identify and fix performance bottlenecks. Visual Studio Online integrates Cloud Load Testing with Application Insights to give deep insights into performance and diagnostics data of your application whichÂ dramatically decreases the discovery and resolution of any issues discovered later. This article will walk you through configuring Load Testing to take advantage of Application Insights. With the latest release of Visual Studio Update 3 RC, you will be able to monitor any of the performance counters during the load run.
