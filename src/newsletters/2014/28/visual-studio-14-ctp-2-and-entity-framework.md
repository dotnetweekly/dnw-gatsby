Today we’re providing a second CTP of the next version of Visual Studio, to gather your early feedback. For more information on this release, see <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=400850">Visual Studio “14” CTPs</a>. This post covers the places that Entity Framework is included in the release and some limitations to be aware of when using it. The EF related information for CTP 2 is very similar to what we provided for the first CTP of Visual Studio “14”. In the next preview of Visual Studio “14” we will be updating the EF6.x components to the latest version. The builds of EF7 will also become more usable in future previews as we round out the implementation of the core pieces of the EF7 code base.
