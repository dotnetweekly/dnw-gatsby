Although C# 6.0 isn’t yet complete, it’s at a point now where the features are close to being finalized. There have been a number of changes and improvements made to C# 6.0 in the CTP3 release of the next version of Visual Studio, code-named “14,” since the May 2014 article, “A C# 6.0 Language Preview” (msdn.microsoft.com/magazine/dn683793.aspx).
