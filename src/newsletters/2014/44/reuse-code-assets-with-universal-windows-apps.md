A lot has changedsince I wrote my July 2013 article, “Building Apps for Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8” (<a id="ctl00_MTContentSelector1_mainContentContainer_ctl02" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/%C3%82%C2%ADmagazine/dn296517">msdn.microsoft.com/magazine/dn296517</a>). Today, developers with experience building apps for Windows 8.1 can reuse code and share assets to build new experiences for Windows Phone 8.1. Windows Phone 8 developers can also maximize the same code base when targeting Windows Phone 8.1. Visual Studio 2013, together with a unified Windows Runtime, makes it possible to develop apps that target Windows Phone 8.1 and other Windows devices from one Visual Studio solution. This new approach allows developers to significantly broaden the user base of their apps while maximizing code reuse.
