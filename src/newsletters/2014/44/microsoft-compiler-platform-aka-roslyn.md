A bit over a year ago I wrote and talked about Roslyn a fair bit, a lot has happened in this last year both in terms of the progression of the C# language and the compiler platform itself. Most notably is probably the decision to make the compiler platform open source which happened earlier this year. With the decision to open source the compiler platform, it meant that the community could take part of what is the next version of the languages, what the compilers looks like under the hood and most interesting of them all: the decision making behind language features and directions of the project. - See more at: http://blog.filipekberg.se/2014/10/31/microsoft-compiler-platform-aka-roslyn/#sthash.KFUCbJUB.dpuf
