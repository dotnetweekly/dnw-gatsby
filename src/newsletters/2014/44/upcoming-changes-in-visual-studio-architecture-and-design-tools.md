This post explains some of our plans for evolving our architecture and design tools in Visual Studio, including new capabilities and changes to existing capabilities that we will be delivering in the next major release and subsequent updates. Although these plans have already been informed by an analysis of usage data and talking extensively with customers, with this post we hope to spread the net even further and ask that you send us feedback on the overall direction and specific changes we are making so that we can affirm (or not) the direction we are taking and figure out how to solve any unmet need.
