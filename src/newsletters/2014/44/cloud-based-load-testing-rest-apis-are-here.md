Many of you are looking at being more agile when it comes to testing, and with increased focus on automation, there are quite a few who wants to integrate Load Testing as a regular test practice. This could be either for those validating performance of their nightly/weekly builds or those that just does not want to wait for big milestone releases to validate performance but instead do it as part of a more frequent Automated Testing. This is more of a “culture” thing and one that is catching up fast.
