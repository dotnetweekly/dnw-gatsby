A Single Page Application (SPA) is a web application that fits on a single web page. In this type of application, the server provides static HTML views, CSS and JavaScript and the application then loads data by making Ajax calls to the server. All subsequent views and navigation occurs without a postback to the server. This architecture provides a more fluid user experience just like a desktop application.
