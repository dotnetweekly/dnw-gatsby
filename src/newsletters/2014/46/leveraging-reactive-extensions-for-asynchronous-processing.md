With most methods, you just want to call the method to get back a single result. Sometimes, however, you need to call a method that returns multiple results. And, sometimes, you'd like to process those results as the method produces them, rather than wait and get all the results at the end. In one of <a href="http://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2014/10/01/writing-cleaner-code-with-reactive-extensions.aspx" target="_blank">last month's columns</a>, I showed how Microsoft Reactive Extensions could be used to solve that problem by catching notifications about a series of changes made by a process that performed operations on a SalesOrder object.
