Unit testing is a cornerstone of modern development. The benefits of unit testing for a project are pretty well understood: Unit testing decreases the number of bugs, reduces time to market and discourages overly coupled design. Those are all nice benefits, but there are further advantages more directly relevant to developers. When I write unit tests, I can have much greater confidence in the code. Itâ€™s easier to add features or fix bugs in tested code, because the unit tests act as a safety net while the code is changing.
