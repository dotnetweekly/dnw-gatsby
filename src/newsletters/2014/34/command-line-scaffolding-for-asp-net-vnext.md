In previous releases we have added support for scaffolding controllers/views based on project artifacts in both MVC and Web Forms projects. The technology used for those previous releases was tied to Visual Studio. With ASP.NET vNext one of our high level goals is to enable Visual Studio customers to work with non-Visual Studio users. So the most critical aspects of developing/testing ASP.NET vNext projects should be available to the non-Visual Studio. Scaffolding is a good example of this.
