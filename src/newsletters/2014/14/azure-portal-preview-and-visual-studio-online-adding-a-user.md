Today at the Build Conference, we showed a preview of the new Azure Portal, and that includes a preview of deep <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/bharry/archive/2014/04/03/visual-studio-online-integration-in-the-azure-portal.aspx">integration with Visual Studio Online</a>. As with any preview, it has some rough edges and limitations. One of the limitations is that <strong>you have to create a new Visual Studio Online account through the new Azure Portal Preview</strong>. Your existing account will not work right now. All new accounts created through the new portal will be backed by Azure Active Directory. In the near future we will provide an experience to convert your existing Visual Studio Online account.
