Python is a strongly typed language with dynamic semantics. Itâ€™s usually executed via an interpreter but it can be JIT compiled. Python works, more or less, equally well on the major desktop and server environments: Linux, Windows, and OS X. Python is a powerful, scalable, and expressive language. Some notable companies that use Python include DropBox (client and server), YouTube, Reddit, Digg, Instagram, Rdio, Pintrest, Google, and Microsoft.

Although we in the .NET community tend to stay focused on the Windows platform and Visual Studio space, it's worth noting how popular and successful Python is becoming in the broader tech industry.
