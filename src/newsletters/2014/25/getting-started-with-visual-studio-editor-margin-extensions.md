Extending visual studio is fun. As a developer I used to spend much time on Visual Studio and automate many problems that is relevent to me. Visual Studio is a powerful editor and using extensibility project templates it is very easy to extend Visual Studio. We can plug many things to the IDE as a Visual Studio Package or a Visual Studio AddIn based on our needs.
