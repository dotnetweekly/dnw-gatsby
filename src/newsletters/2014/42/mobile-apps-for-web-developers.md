The path of a mobile app developer often begins with a choice: <em>develop for iOS, Android or Windows?</em> Itâ€™s a choice that instantly diminishes the size of your potential audience, but developers often hold their nose and reluctantly make a decision. Those who need to reach all three app stores, choose to rewrite the application for each platform. Visual Studio enables you to have maximum reach while achieving significant code re-use. With Xamarin, C# developers can share business logic across iOS, Android, and Windows applications. With Apache Cordova, web developers can achieve maximal code re-use by building cross-platform mobile applications using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
