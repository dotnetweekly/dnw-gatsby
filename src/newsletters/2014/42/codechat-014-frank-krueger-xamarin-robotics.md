My guest this week on Channel 9, Frank Krueger, isn't just <em>using</em> the Xamarin Robotics library for controlling his little homemade robot, he's <em>writing</em> it! Just days off of an ascent of Kilimanjaro, Frank gets back to real life and gives us a formal introduction to this slick little critter and tells all about the hardware and software he used to make it go. It's the same hardware and software that you can use on your own project. Let's go.
