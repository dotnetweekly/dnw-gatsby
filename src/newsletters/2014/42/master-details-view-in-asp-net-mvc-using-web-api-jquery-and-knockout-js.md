One of the top-most requirements that a developer comes across while developing Line of Business (LoB) applications is to provide users with a way to view a Master list of product they are managing. When they click on any of the rows, a Details view appears with all records that are related to the Master view. This is also referred to as a Master-Detail Tabular view. For example, in an order management application, a detail view could provide information about Orders placed by Customers (Master view).
