Maintaining a large code base is hard. Diving in and understanding an unfamiliar code base is even harder. But every developer has had to do this at some point in his career. There are multiple approaches you can take, most of which usually end up with you using a piece of paper to diagram out relationships in your code. Visual Studio 2012 provides an architecture tool to help with this: the dependency graph. With dependency graphs, you can easily create a visual representation of a project or solution, which you can drill into for details. Visual Studio 2012 Update 1 provides an even more user-friendly tool for creating and manipulating this type of visualization, called a code map.
