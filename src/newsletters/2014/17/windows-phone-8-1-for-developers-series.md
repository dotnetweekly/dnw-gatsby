In today's Mobile Monday post we're highlighting an awesome series from the Jayway team, Robert Hedgate, Andreas Hammar, Alexander Persson, Johan Silfversparre, Johan Olsson, Andreas Ekberg, Lars-Håkan Jönsson and Peter Mataic. This on going series on developing for Windows Phone 8.1 starts with getting started (I know, funny that) through most, if not all, the new features available on Windows Phone 8.1 (which if you've not been looking it, is a massive update and is pretty awesome. I've been using it on my phone since release day and am impressed every day. 8.1 really is a v9 in all it's features, improvements and capabilities...)
