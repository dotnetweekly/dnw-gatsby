Creating a game for Windows 8 is easy and fun with Construct 2. Construct 2 is a HTML5 based game editor developed by Scirra. It is targeted primarily for non-programmers for developing games in a drag-and-drop fashion in a visual editor and a behavior-based logic system.  Construct 2 is a game framework to support cross platforms including Windows 8, Windows Phone 8, iOS, Android, Chrome Web Store, Web (HTML) and Facebook.
