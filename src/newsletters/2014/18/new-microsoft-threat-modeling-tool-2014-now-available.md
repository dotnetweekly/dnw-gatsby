Today weâ€™re announcing the release of the Microsoft Threat Modeling Tool 2014. This is the latest version of the free Security Development Lifecycle Threat Modeling Tool that was previously released back in 2011.

More and more of the customers I have been talking to have been leveraging threat modeling as a systematic way to find design-level security and privacy weaknesses in systems they are building and operating. Threat modeling is also used to help identify mitigations that can reduce the overall risk to a system and the data it processes. Once customers try threat modeling, they typically find it to be a useful addition to their approach to risk management.
