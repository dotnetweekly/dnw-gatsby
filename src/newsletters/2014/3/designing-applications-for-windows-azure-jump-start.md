â€‹Developers, do you wonder how to design apps for the cloud? Are you interested in best practices for architectures that include services that run in the cloud? Join Marc Mercuri for a day of design and architecture lessons for Windows Azure developers. You'll see how services impact your design choices, examples of great Windows Azure application design, and the most current architecture guidance. Marc will also highlight scale, peaks in use, down time, and cost for usage-based fee structures.
