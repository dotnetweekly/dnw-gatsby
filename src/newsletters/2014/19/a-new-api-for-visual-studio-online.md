The “big” news that I announced at TechEd this week was a new API for accessing Visual Studio Online (and, in a future release, Team Foundation Server).  This new API is based on REST, OAUTH, Json and Service Hooks – all standard web technologies broadly supported in the industry.  The API is still currently in preview while we take feedback and refine it.
