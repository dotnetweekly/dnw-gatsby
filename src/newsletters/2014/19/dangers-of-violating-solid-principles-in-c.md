There have been some fantastic software development principles captured under the SOLID acronym—Single responsibility, Open for extension and closed for modification, Liskov substitution, Interface segregation, and Dependency injection. You should have some familiarity with these principles, as I’ll demonstrate a variety of C#-specific patterns that violate these principles. If you’re unfamiliar with the SOLID principles, you might want to review them quickly before proceeding. I’ll also assume some familiarity with the architectural terms Model and ViewModel.
