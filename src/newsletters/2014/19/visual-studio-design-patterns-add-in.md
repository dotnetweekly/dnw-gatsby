If you have been programming using a object oriented language, then you must have heard of <a title="design patterns" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_pattern_(computer_science)" target="_blank">design patterns</a>. There are a number of books and web sites on this topic, but while using Visual Studio, you would have to go out of the IDE, refresh your memory about what a particular software pattern does and type or copy the code for it. Wouldn't be easier to have an integrated Visual Studio tool to help you select the right pattern and insert the code for you with only a few clicks? This is exactly what this Visual Studio add-in does: it indexes some commonly known OO patterns, presents them in easy to search user interface and inserts the code into your working project.
