There are several different tools that you, the DBA, or another individual can use to deploy a DACPAC as defined in <a href="http://msmvps.com/blogs/deborahk/archive/2014/02/05/deploying-a-dacpac.aspx" target="_blank">this prior post</a>. This current post details how to deploy a DACPAC using <strong>Visual Studio</strong>. Starting with Visual Studio 2013, the SQL Server data tools (SSDT) are available in*every* edition of Visual Studio, including the Express editions. So the DBA or other deployment personnel can use one of the free Express editions of Visual Studio to manage database projects and deploy DACPACs.
