In Windows 8, we introduced several concepts and controls to deal with large collections of data. The <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/windows.ui.xaml.controls.listview.aspx" target="_blank">XAML</a> and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/br211837.aspx" target="_blank">HTML</a> ListView control allows you to create uniform grouped lists with a single, homogeneous data source. We also provided guidelines for the hierarchical presentation of data called the <i>hub pattern</i>. Many developers adopted these controls and patterns to create great apps. We saw a lot of innovation and new usage cases in these apps, and heard feedback from you about the additional features youâ€™d like to see in the future. In Windows 8.1, we got the opportunity to analyze these evolving designs.
