Machine-to-machine (M2M) computing is fast becoming a technology that all developers and architects need to embrace. Numerous studies suggest a coming world of tens of billions of devices (a half-dozen for every human on earth) by 2020 (bit.ly/M2qBII). One reason this is happening is because it has never been easier for garage tinkerers and hobbyists to prototype a consumer or commercial device for later manufacture and sale. Getting started with both the hardware and software is incredibly inexpensive. For less than $100, you can order an Arduino or a Raspberry PI.
