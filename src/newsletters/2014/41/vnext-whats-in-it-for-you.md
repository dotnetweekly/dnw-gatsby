Microsoft is building a new framework for you: vNext. It won't be as radical a change as moving to the original Microsoft .NET Framework, but it will be like moving to the .NET Framework 2.0: Not all of your existing code is compatible with the new framework. And, while there are downloads that let you try vNext out, be careful: You should <em>not</em> install those downloads on a computer with another version of the .NET Framework.
