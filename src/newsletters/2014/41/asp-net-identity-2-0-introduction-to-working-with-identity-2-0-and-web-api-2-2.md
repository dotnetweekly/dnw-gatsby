In recent posts, I've covered a lot of ground using ASP.NET Identity 2.0 in the context of an MVC application. Since it's RTM in March of this year, Identity 2.0 has offered a substantial expansion of the Authentication/Authorization . toolset available to MVC applications. Similarly, Identity 2.0 expands the Identity management tools available through ASP.NET Web Api. The same flexibility and extensibility are available, although things work just a little differently.
