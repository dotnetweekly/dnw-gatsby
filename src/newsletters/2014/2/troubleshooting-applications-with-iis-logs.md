Have you ever tried to troubleshoot or debug an application without having ever seen the code? Have you ever had a malfunctioning application, and neither the browser nor the application provided a useful error code?

These techniques have helped me troubleshoot applications and Web sites in a variety of situations, especially on devices other than PCs—a scenario that is becoming the norm these days. In a recent case, these techniques helped me discover why videos wouldn’t display on Apple devices though they ran perfectly on Windows-based devices.
