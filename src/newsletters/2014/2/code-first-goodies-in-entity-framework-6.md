In my December 2013 article, “Entity Framework 6: The Ninja Edition” (msdn.microsoft.com/magazine/dn532202), I described many of the new features in Entity Framework 6 (EF6). I wasn’t able to delve into every feature, though, so this month I’ll drill into some of the EF6 enhancements specific to Code First. Two of the features I’ll discuss are relevant to Code First mappings, and the others relate to Code First migrations.
