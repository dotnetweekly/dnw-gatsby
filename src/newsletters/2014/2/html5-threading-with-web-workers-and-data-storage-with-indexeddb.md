In this article, I continue exploring HTML5 features with a look at Web Workers, which let you speed up your client-side applications, and Indexed DB, a client-side data storage mechanism that is the preferred storage approach going forward in HTML5.

IndexedDB is the result of follow-on work to create a standard for data storage in Web browsers.)
