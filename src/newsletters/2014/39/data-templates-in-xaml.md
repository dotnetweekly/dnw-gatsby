This is the first in a series of shows featuring speakers from theÂ <a href="http://www.vslive.com/">VSLive</a> conference, which was held in Redmond in August. In this episode, Robert is joined by <a href="http://www.billyhollis.com/">Billy Hollis</a>, who shows us how you can use data templates in XAML to create more interesting and easier to understand user interfaces.
