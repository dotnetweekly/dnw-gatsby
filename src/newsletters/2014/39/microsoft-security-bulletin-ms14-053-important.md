This security update resolves one privately reported vulnerability in Microsoft .NET Framework. The vulnerability could allow denial of service if an attacker sends a small number of specially crafted requests to an affected .NET-enabled website, service, or program that uses Windows Communication Foundation (WCF). By default, no WCF programs are installed when Microsoft .NET Framework is installed on any supported edition of Microsoft Windows. To be affected by the vulnerability, customers must manually install a .NET-enabled website, service, or program that uses Windows Communication Foundation (WCF).
