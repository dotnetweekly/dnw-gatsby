Devs, want to translate your MVC .NET skills to the web platform? Take advantage of jQuery and AngularJS to dynamically update HTML5-based apps, and learn how AJAX works for asynchronous calls. Simplify the development process by separating the model, view, and controller for your web apps, enabling your content to work within a browser and within Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8 apps.
