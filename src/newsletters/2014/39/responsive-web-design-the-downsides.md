I have already written a couple of articles for Simple-Talk about Responsive Web Design (RWD), one of which is “Responsive Web Design: the Costs”. That article and this one together form two-third of a mini-series dedicated to Responsive Web Design as it happens to be today, late summer of 2014. The third article of the series will discuss an approach that takes the core idea of RWD one step further towards the relatively new concept of form-factor.
