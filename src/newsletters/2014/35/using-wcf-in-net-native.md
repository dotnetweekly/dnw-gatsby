In our <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dotnet/archive/2014/08/18/try-out-the-new-releases-net-framework-vnext-asp-net-vnext-net-native-and-ryujit.aspx">previous post</a>, we mentioned that some of the client components of Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) had been made available for .NET Native Windows Store apps in Visual Studio "14" CTP3. In this post, I will describe how to build a sample WCF Windows Store App using CTP3 and make it run using the .NET Native compiler.
