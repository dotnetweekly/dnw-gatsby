Over the past several weeks we’ve been working on addressing some feedback we’ve received from our users and added some improvements, including support for .NET Framework 3.5. Today I’m happy to announce the stable release of the <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventSource">EventSource</a> and the <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Diagnostics.Tracing.EventRegister">EventRegister</a> packages.
