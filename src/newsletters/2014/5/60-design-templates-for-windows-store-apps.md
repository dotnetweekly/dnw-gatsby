I recently tweeted about some upcoming new design templates. At that time, these templates were not released yet. Today, I stumbled on them again. And it turns out that they are available for free on CodePlex. You can see them all here.

It’s not recommended to uses these templates as is. They’re provided as Visual Studio solutions in C# and JS and you should change the design to match your brand, of course.
