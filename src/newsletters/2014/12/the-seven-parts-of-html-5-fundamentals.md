It's Web Wednesday and today we're going to take a step back and share a series by <a href="http://www.davidgiard.com/" target="_blank">David Giard</a>, who's going to give us a fundamental look at HTML5. Oh, I know YOU don't need this, but you might have a "friend" who does (cough... like me... cough...).
