            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Since .NET 5 was announced, many of you have asked what this means for .NET Standard and whether it will still be relevant. In this post, I’m going to explain how .NET 5 improves code sharing and replaces .NET Standard. I’ll also cover the cases where you still need .NET Standard.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[I’ve been using Azure Cosmos DB on a fairly regular basis for the last 2 years or so. It’s a pretty good database, but one thing has always bothered me: the lack of a proper tool to query and modify data in the database. Basically, here are the current options:

The standalone Cosmos DB Explorer website
The Data Explorer in the Azure Portal
Cosmos DB support in Azure Storage Explorer]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[In this article, we’ll look at using OpenAPI with .NET Core. OpenAPI is a specification for describing RESTful APIs. First, I’ll show you how to use OpenAPI to describe the APIs provided by an ASP.NET Core service. Then, we’ll use the API description to generate a strongly-typed client to use the web service with C#.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[One of the quickest ways to earn the ire of a DBA is to shrug your shoulders, and tell them you don't know what code created the query that is slowing down their server. Sure, with a little hunting and knowledge of the code base you can generally spot the offending query, but wouldn't it be nice if the query the DBA is looking at had more information to track it down?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[At the last Ignite, we announced the public preview of Visual Studio Codespaces and shared our vision for cloud-powered development environments that would enable developers to work from anywhere and on any platform. Since then, we’ve seen incredible validation and excitement about codespaces and the scenarios they enable. We’ve also shipped dozens of enhancements, adjusted to better align with your expectations, and amassed feedback to help inform our roadmap. A key piece of this roadmap was partnering with our friends at GitHub to provide a native experience using the same service that powers Visual Studio Codespaces. Today, we’d like to share some news regarding this partnership: Visual Studio Codespaces will be consolidating into GitHub Codespaces.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Today, we are shipping .NET 5.0 Release Candidate 1 (RC1). It is a near-final release of .NET 5.0, and the first of two RCs before the official release in November. RC1 is a “go live” release; you are supported using it in production. At this point, we’re looking for reports of any remaining critical bugs that should be fixed before the final release. We need your feedback to get .NET 5.0 across the finish line.]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Microsoft is dedicated to working with the community and our customers to continuously improve and tune our platform and products to help defend against the dynamic and sophisticated threat landscape. Earlier this year, we announced that we would replace the existing software testing experience known as Microsoft Security and Risk Detection with an automated, open-source tool as the industry moved toward this model. Today, we’re excited to release this new tool called Project OneFuzz, an extensible fuzz testing framework for Azure. Available through GitHub as an open-source tool, the testing framework used by Microsoft Edge, Windows, and teams across Microsoft is now available to developers around the world.]]></content:encoded>

            <pubDate>Thu, 17 Sep 2020 10:27:46 GMT</pubDate>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Are we at the point now where the golden rule of ‘not storing passwords in plain-text’ should be a given? I would hope so, but that doesn’t change the fact that there are many ways to disguise sensitive data being saved to databases, so I thought I’d give a basic example of how it can be done in C#.]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[In this article, we'll take a look at the new Target-typed capabilities in C# 9.0. Target-typed means that the compiler will now infer the type from the context; thus, you won't have to specify it explicitly. It helps simplify your code and make it more readable.]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[At the time of writing this post, without third-party plug-ins, server-side Blazor doesn't have native support for hot-reload. I was kind of spoiled with this luxury when working with Angular, so I decided to find out if there was a workaround. Guess what...There is!]]></content:encoded>
