            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Project Jupyter is a non-profit, open-source project, born out of the IPython Project in 2014 as it evolved to support interactive data science and scientific computing across all programming languages. Jupyter will always be 100% open-source software, free for all to use and released under the liberal terms of the modified BSD license.

Jupyter is developed in the open on GitHub, through the consensus of the Jupyter community. For more information on our governance approach, please see our Governance Document.]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Using docker images for development is a super power, you don’t need SQL installed on your development machine, yet you still have the full power of SQL there for you when you need it. Also, if you want specific versions for different projects, you can simply spin up the version you want, and keep all the configuration inside a dockerfile in your repository for that project.

In this article, we are going to:

Download the latest SQL Server docker image locally
Create a docker container and connect to it from SQL Server Management Studio
Setup a volume mount to store the database files outside of the container so we can persist the data when we tear down our container
Set this up with a docker-compose file]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[This is the fifth of a new series of posts on ASP .NET Core 3.1 for 2020. In this series, we’ll cover 26 topics over a span of 26 weeks from January through June 2020, titled ASP .NET Core A-Z! To differentiate from the 2019 series, the 2020 series will mostly focus on a growing single codebase (NetLearner!) instead of new unrelated code snippets week.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[The Visual Studio Online (VS Online) web-based IDE is now available to be used. Based on the popular Visual Studio Code editor, it offers a familiar feel and workspace for writing and working with source code.. This also offers the extensibility of supporting Visual Studio Code extensions, although at this time we don’t know how many or which VS Code extensions will be supported.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[This article is a follow up on a previous post titled "UI Automation - Page Object Model and other Design Patterns" and is part of a series of posts related to UI Test automation, if you are interested in UI automation tools in general, we definitely recommend checking out our earlier post:  "What are the best UI Test Automation Tools?" which was published on this same blog not so long ago. You may want to have a look at those two articles since it provides a high level view of what tools are available in the market for Functional UI Test automation, either for Web, Mobile or Desktop and then a deeper analysis of code design approaches.

In this article I will describe broadly the technical highlights of how Desktop UI automation is done and I will describe the main features of a relatively new test framework that is becoming a must-use for UI automation for Windows-based applications.]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[I've been using Azure App Services (e.g. WebApps) for a few years now. I've been mostly happy with the result. Though I've had some trouble with the way that the App Service environment works from time to time (mostly with the version of .NET Core that is running).

To try and eliminate that (and possibly save some cost), I decided to switch my apps to use Docker Containers. I thought I'd share how I did it in case you want to do this as well.

This will be a three part series:

Getting an ASP.NET Core project running on Docker Desktop (this post)

Deploying Docker Images to Azure App Services (here)

Automating Docker Image Deployment with GitHub Actions (coming soon)]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[I’m excited to announce experimental support for gRPC-Web with .NET. gRPC-Web allows gRPC to be called from browser-based apps like JavaScript SPAs or Blazor WebAssembly apps.

gRPC-Web for .NET promises to bring many of gRPC’s great features to browser apps:

Strongly-typed code-generated clients
Compact Protobuf messages
Server streaming]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Progressive Web Apps are a (terribly named) wonderful idea. You can build an app once using web technologies which serves all devices and form factors. It can be accessible over the web, but also surface on the home screen of your Android / iOS device. That app can work offline, have a splash screen when it launches and have notifications too.]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[One of our Calavista development teams and I are having a kind of kickoff meeting tomorrow morning to discuss our new technical stack that we plan to use for some big new customer-facing features in a large web application this year. The current application we’re building onto was originally designed about a decade ago and uses a lot of the .Net tools and approaches that I myself would have espoused at that time and even a few OSS things that I helped build — but some of which are clearly aluminum wiring today (RIP K. Scott Allen) or at least have been surpassed by later tools.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[According to the State of DevOps 2019, best practice use of version control is one of the foundations for improving Software Delivery and Operational (SDO) Performance. In this first part of a three part guide, you'll be working with Git and Azure DevOps to setup a repository which you'll use for source control. Source control, also known as version control, has many benefits, each of these benefits come together to create a feedback loop to a team working on the code under version control. These benefits include:

Collaboration - teams can work concurrently, even on the same sections of code, which are merged together.
Workflows - teams check the quality of each others code, ensuring compliance with coding standards.
Versioning - source code can be tagged so that released versions of code can be referred back to,
History - a full history of the code repository is maintained and linked to a users credentials. If changes are well commented, this can assist in issue resolution.
Automation - actions within a version control system, such as checking in a code change, can be set to trigger other operatons, such as compilation and testing.]]></content:encoded>
