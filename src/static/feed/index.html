            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Modern web apps are increasingly adopting static front-end design patterns with client-side processing powered by JavaScript. This paradigm requires us to think differently about how we deploy and host web apps that donâ€™t rely on web servers and consequently require a new structure of supporting cloud resources. This week at Build, our annual celebration of all things developer, we are happy to announce that Azure App Service has been expanded with a new hosting offer tailored specifically for static web apps, empowering developers to focus on the business logic that differentiates their apps rather than the infrastructure that hosts them.

App Service Static Web Apps is now available in preview for developers building modern, full-stack JavaScript web apps with static front-ends and optional dynamic back-ends powered by serverless APIs.]]></content:encoded>
