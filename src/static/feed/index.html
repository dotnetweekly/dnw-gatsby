            <content:encoded><![CDATA[With the new previews of dotnetcore there are new project templates but also a more generic hosting system, instead of having a Web specific host builder or Worker/services host builder there is a new "generic" host which they are all based on. These are all brought together under IHost.

With this and other patterns/practices there are now multiple ways of registering your services. Let's take a look.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Since I’ve been working with the community on porting desktop applications from .NET Framework to .NET Core, I’ve noticed that there are two camps of folks: some want a very simple and short list of instructions to get their apps ported to .NET Core while others prefer a more principled approach with more background information. Instead of writing up a “Swiss Army knife”-document, we are going to publish two blog posts, one for each camp:

This post is the simple case. It’s focused on simple instructions and smaller applications and is the easiest way to move your app to .NET Core.
We will publish another post for more complicated cases. This post will focus more on non-trivial applications, such WPF application with dependencies on WCF and third-party UI packages.]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[For many customers around the world, securely connecting from the outside to workloads and virtual machines on private networks can be challenging. Exposing virtual machines to the public Internet to enable connectivity through Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and Secure Shell (SSH), increases the perimeter, rendering your critical networks and attached virtual machines more open and harder to manage.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[With .NET Core 3.0 Preview 6 out the door, we thought it would be useful to take a brief look at the history of our infrastructure systems and the significant improvements that have been made in the last year or so.

This post will be interesting if you are interested in build infrastructure or want a behind-the-scenes look at how we build a product as big as .NET Core. It doesn’t describe new features or sample code that you should use in your next application. Please tell us if you like these types of posts. We have a few more like this planned, but would appreciate knowing if you find this type of information helpful.]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[In my career, I have tried multiple translation tools for handling localization. This usually ends up in a spreadsheet sent back and forth that gets imported/exported with the actual translation tool. I have also tried giving my translators and customers direct access to the translation tool but that never really worked as they tend to blindly translate everything they see and usually miss out on the fact that some strings contain important placeholders that executable code expects. Anyway, at the end of the sending a spreadsheet back and forth seems to always work.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[We'll go through the basics of Promises and callbacks, and demonstrate the simplicity of promisifying the old XMLHttpRequest API.

It is no longer news that new JavaScript development patterns since the evolution of ES6 have influenced how we approach certain things in the JavaScript ecosystem. For instance, the standard callback function syntax which has been a standard for years. However, a new alternative, Promises, is now a more preferred pattern of development.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Cryptography is a very important thing for information security. Information security is composed of 4 parts:

Integrity: ensure a document is not altered
Confidentiality: ensure only authorized people can read a document
Authentication: ensure the document was written by an identified person
Non-Repudiation: prove who/where a document came from as well as the authenticity of that message, so the sender cannot deny they have sent it
Let's see what .NET provides for each part!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[The need to do things in an asynchronous way – that is, dividing big tasks between multiple working units – was present long before the appearance of computers. However, when they did appear, this need became even more obvious. It is now 2019, and I’m writing this article on a laptop powered by an 8-core Intel Core CPU which, in addition to this, is simultaneously working on hundreds of processes, with the number of threads being even larger. Next to me, there lies a slightly outdated smartphone which I bought a couple of years ago – and it also houses an 8-core processor. Specialized web resources contain a wide variety of articles praising this year’s flagship smartphones equipped with 16-core CPUs. For less then $20 per hour, MS Azure can give you access to a 128-core virtual machine with 2 TB RAM. But, unfortunately, you cannot get the most out of this power unless you know how to control interaction between threads.

write fast and cross-platform desktop apps.

You can be ambitious for speed if you discover Electronjs technology that outperforms desktop technologies on Windows such as WPF and WinForms. You notice that performance if you use Visual Studio Code the most popular code editor in the world.]]></content:encoded>
