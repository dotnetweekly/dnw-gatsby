            <content:encoded><![CDATA[In the previous article, we started exploring some of the basic machine learning algorithms and learned how to use ML.NET. There we covered Linear Regression, its variations and we implemented it from scratch with C#. In this article, we focus on the classification algorithm or to be more precise, the algorithms that are used primarily for classification problems. Note that we will not cover all the classification algorithms, for example, SVM and Decisions Trees, because these algorithms can be used for regression as well, so they will get separated articles just for them.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Tailwind CSS is self-described as a utility first CSS framework. Rather than focusing on the functionality of the item being styled, Tailwind is centered around how it should be displayed. This makes it easier for the developer to test out new styles and change the layout. We ask Jen Looper about Tailwind, and how this approach can help us out!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[The first security principle that I am going to discuss is one that most System Administrators are familiar with: the “principle of least privilege” (short: POLP). It demands that the required permissions for a task shall only grant access to the needed information or resources that a task requires. When permissions are granted, we shall grant the least privileges possible.

POLP is so crucial because initially it is the privileges that any attacker is targeting. When developing an application, using a least-privileged user account (LUA) is the first rule of engagement.]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Imagine running a .NET Core application in Kubernetes, which suddenly starts being sluggish, and the telemetry fails to give you a complete picture of the issue. To remediate performance issues of applications, starting with .NET Core 3, Microsoft introduced several .NET Core runtime diagnostics tools to diagnose application issues.

dotnet-counters to view Performance Counters.
dotnet-dump to capture and analyze Dumps.
dotnet-trace to capture runtime events and sample CPU stacks.
dotnet-gcdump to collect Garbage Collector dumps of application.
