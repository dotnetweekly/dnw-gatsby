            <content:encoded><![CDATA[In the last post, I looked at creating a generic host endpoint that many of the deployed versions in Azure can share. By using a hosted service, we can then host NServiceBus in just about anything that can work with the .NET Core generic host. The differences then come to hosting and scaling models.

First up is the closest we have to "Platform-as-a-Service" for background tasks - Azure WebJobs. WebJobs can be any executable/script, but a very common model for building is to use the Azure WebJobs SDK.]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[GraphQL has been gaining wide adoption as a way of building and consuming Web APIs. GraphQL is a specification that defines a type system, query language, and schema language for your Web API, and an execution algorithm for how a GraphQL service (or engine) should validate and execute queries against the GraphQL schema. It’s upon this specification that the tools and libraries for building GraphQL applications are built.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Enums are a double-edged sword. They are extremely useful to create a set of possible values, but they can be a versioning problem if you ever add a value to that enum.

In a perfect world, an enum represents a closed set of values, so versioning is never a problem because you never add a value to an enum. However, we live in the real, non-perfect world and what seemed like a closed set of values often turns out to be open.
