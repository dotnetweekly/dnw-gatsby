            <content:encoded><![CDATA[In May 20th 2020, Microsoft introduced C# 9, among the features announced, there is one that has not yet been talked about much: covariant returns. Usually in C# when we inherit from a class, it is possible to override a method if it is declared abstract or virtual but it is not possible to change the return type of this method. C# 9 allows this, In addition to overriding a virtual or abstract method, in C# 9 you can now return a covariant type of the initial type declared in the parent class. For example, you can now return a type that is inherited from the parent class. In this article I will show you how it works with a very simple example and compare with earlier versions of C# 9. This post was produced with input from Dave Brock. Dave recently posted some really interesting C # 9 articles which you can find here: https://daveabrock.com/2020/06/29/c-sharp-9-deep-dive-inits

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Since the early days of C# 9, I’ve been doing writeups on all of the new features including init-only properties, record types, top level programs and more. And ever since those writeups, I’ve had people say “Yeah, I get I can read that, but can you just give me the gist of how to use the feature?”. I thought that a single page writeup would be short enough but I do get that it’s sometimes easier to explain in a 1 minute video. And so that’s what I’ve done!

It’s designed for current .NET developers to explore all the choices available to them when developing games. It’s also designed for new developers trying to learn how to use .NET by making games. We’ve also launched a new game development Learn portal for .NET filled with tutorials, videos, and documentation provided by Microsoft and others in the .NET game development community. Finally, we launched a step-by-step Unity get-started tutorial that will get you started with Unity and writing C# scripts for it in no time. We are excited to show you what .NET has to offer to you when making games. .NET is also part of Microsoft Game Stack, a comprehensive suite of tools and services just for game development.
