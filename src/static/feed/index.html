            <content:encoded><![CDATA[The idea of immutable types is great but without the proper support from the language syntax, it might not be worth applying. In this article, I’m going to present the results of my experiments with Roslyn analyzers that simulate types immutability without the need of writing large amount of boilerplate code.]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[In the early years of web development, there were three standard fundamentals upon which every website was built: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As time passed, web developers became more proficient in their construction of fancy UI/UX widgets for websites. With the need for newer ways of crafting a site coming in conflict with the relatively slow adoption of newer standards, more and more developers began to build their own libraries to abstract away some of the technical details. The web ceased being a standard: now your website could be a React site, or an Angular site, or a Vue site, or any number of other web framework that are not interoperable with each other.

Web components seek to tilt the balance of web development back towards a standard agreed upon by browser vendors and developers. Various polyfills and proprietary frameworks have achieved what web components are now trying to standardize: composable units of JavaScript and HTML that can be imported and reused across web applications. Let's explore the history of web components and the advantages they provide over third-party libraries.]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[GitHub Apps are a GitHub's preferred way to build more sophissticated functionality on top of GitHub. GitHub apps are a separate concept from GitHub OAuth Apps, which causes a lot of confusion.

Here's how you can think of the difference: GitHub OAuth Apps can act on behalf of a user, but GitHub Apps are distinct "users" that can act on their own. If you authorize a GitHub OAuth App and that app posts on an issue, it looks as if you posted it. But if you install a GitHub App and that app posts on an issue, the post comes from a distinct user.]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Looking to build a new app, develop and test, or run small production workloads with Azure Cosmos DB? Our new Free Tier makes it easy to get started with no cost and save money as you build and grow new apps.

With Azure Cosmos DB Free Tier enabled, you’ll get the first 400 RU/s throughput and 5 GB storage in your account for free each month, for the lifetime of the account. That means that you can start small and grow with confidence, knowing your app will be running on a high-performance database service. You’ll only pay if your account exceeds 400 RU/s and 5 GB. Additionally, if your app has a lot of containers you can create up to 25 containers in a shared throughput database and have them all share the free 400 RU/s. You can have up to one free tier Azure Cosmos DB account per Azure subscription.]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[I've experienced a handful of times that an application has slowed down sufficiently without a code change. So, what could (change to) make an application slower over time? Mostly, the answer to this question is data. To be more specific, the amount of data that an application has to process.]]></content:encoded>
