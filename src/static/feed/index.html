            <content:encoded><![CDATA[What Is A Memory Leak?
In general, a memory leak is a process in which a program or application persistently retains a computer’s primary memory. It occurs when the resident memory program does not return or release allocated memory space, even after execution, resulting in slower or unresponsive system behavior.

In unmanaged code, a memory leak is a failure to release unreachable memory, which can no longer be allocated again by any process during execution of the allocating process. This can mostly be cured by using GC (Garbage Collection) techniques or detected by automated tools.]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Web performance is a tricky beast, isn’t it? How do we actually know where we stand in terms of performance, and what our performance bottlenecks exactly are? Is it expensive JavaScript, slow web font delivery, heavy images, or sluggish rendering? Is it worth exploring tree-shaking, scope hoisting, code-splitting, and all the fancy loading patterns with intersection observer, server push, clients hints, HTTP/2, service workers and — oh my — edge workers? And, most importantly, where do we even start improving performance and how do we establish a performance culture long-term?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[In recent years, we've seen extraordinary growth in Computer Vision, with applications in image understanding, search, mapping, semi-autonomous or autonomous vehicles and many more.  
 

The ability for models to understand actions in a video, a task that was unthinkable just a few years ago, is now something that we can achieve with relatively high accuracy and in near real-time. ]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Microservices based applications consist of multiple services and are built with a variety of programming languages. Based on the business use case, you can pick the most appropriate technology to build your service. gRPC can be one of those choices.

Today we chat with Sourahb to find out more about gRPC and ASP.NET Core apps.

[01:04] - Where does gRPC come from?
[02:40] - What's different about gRPC, why this?
[06:15] - Contract based development, types, strongly type clients, like WCF?
[09:45] - Demo time!
[17:23] - What's next for .NET Core and gRPC / Roadmap?
[19:22] - Are there any challenges running gRPC?]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[In 2015, a rich set of new features was introduced to the JavaScript community. Things like arrow functions, classes and modules quickly became popular and are heavily used in modern JavaScript programming. Some other features are less known and used by developers nowadays. Do you know what generators are? This is exactly what we will learn in this article.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[In this article, we are going to talk about a neat concept called data shaping and how to implement it in ASP.NET Core Web API. To achieve that, we are going to use similar tools as we did in the sorting article. Data shaping is not something that every API needs, but it can be very useful in some cases.
