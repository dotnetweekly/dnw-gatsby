            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Modern web apps are increasingly adopting static front-end design patterns with client-side processing powered by JavaScript. This paradigm requires us to think differently about how we deploy and host web apps that don’t rely on web servers and consequently require a new structure of supporting cloud resources. This week at Build, our annual celebration of all things developer, we are happy to announce that Azure App Service has been expanded with a new hosting offer tailored specifically for static web apps, empowering developers to focus on the business logic that differentiates their apps rather than the infrastructure that hosts them.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Performance sensitive code is often overlooked in business apps. This is because high-performance code might not affect outcomes. Concerns with execution times are ignorable if the code finishes in a reasonable time. Apps either meet expectations or not, and performance issues can go undetected. Devs, for the most part, care about business outcomes and performance is the outlier. When response times cross an arbitrary line, everything flips to less than desirable or unacceptable.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[In this article, let’s go through Serilog in ASP.NET Core 3.1 and it’s implementations. Now by default, ASP.NET Core comes with some basic logging features built-in. You must have seen the ILogger interface throughout your ASP.NET Core Application. But what if we want more control over how and where to log the details? That is where Logging Frameworks / Libraries come into play. Out of all of them, Serilog is one of the most popular Libraries for ASP.NET Core Applications.]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.dotnetweekly.com/articles/refresh-tokens-in-aspnet-core-apis-jwt-authentication</guid>
            <pubDate>Wed, 27 May 2020 16:49:41 GMT</pubDate>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[To enhance the security of APIs that already use JWT Tokens, even more, we use something called Refresh Tokens.

What are they?

Refresh Tokens are random numbers/strings/combinations that are sent as a response along with the JSON Web Token back to the client, with which a user can request for valid JWT.

Issues it solves.

What if an attacker gets hold of your JWT Token? With this token, he could potentially access a secured API mimicking your usage, and compromise the entire service if he wants to. This is bad.

With JWT Token, it is advised that they must expire is less than a day (due to the above security concern). Usually, the standard is a few hours tops. So what happens when the token expires? The user get's logged out of the system and is prompted to log in again with his/her credentials. Now that is bad user experience in today's world.

I have written a detailed Article/ Guide on Refresh Tokens in ASP.NET Core APIs. Give it a look.]]></content:encoded>
