            <content:encoded><![CDATA[It was not that long ago that I had to manage the cache to get informations that rarely change. My goal was to avoid making HTTP hits to the server, so I had to eliminate the distributed cache and the memory cache. So I only had as solution the HTTP response cache by attributes because client side caching. But something bothered me, I wanted to have the possibility of benefiting from a greater flexibility in parameters management, for example by using dependency injection to inject parameters rather than using caching profiles. So I had the idea of building a caching middleware, conditional on the route used, in order to have the same behavior as an action or controller attribute. In this article I wanted to explain to you how I did it.]]></content:encoded>

Until now, if your organization wanted to use GitHub for private development, you had to subscribe to one of our paid plans. But every developer on earth should have access to GitHub. Price shouldn’t be a barrier.]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[When working with GitHub Repositories, the Github.com website provides an excellent interface for working with Issues, Pull Requests, and Repositories. Of course, when committing file changes and merging branches, you still use the git CLI. However, this requires context switching between CLI and browser. Luckily, the GitHub CLI (gh) offers a full command-line / terminal experience for working with GitHub. Here’s a cheat sheet I’ve put together that showcases many of the GitHub CLI commands to help you be more productive at the command-line as you perform operations against your GitHub Pull Requests, Issues, and Repositories!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Svelte is a Javascript framework, a compiler and a language. Unlike other Frameworks such as React and Vue which do much of their work in the browser, Svelte does its work in the compile step, which results in highly efficient code and a potentially faster run-time on the client-side.

  In this course, Noah Kaufman will teach you Svelte by building a fun chatbot. The course contains several interactive coding challenges, where you'll be encouraged to write your first lines of Svelte code. This will solidify your learning, so we strongly encourage you to do these challenges along the way.]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[If there is one thing that’s important right now, it’s securing your environment. With most workers now operating outside the firewall, having features like multi-factor authentication turned on are critically important to keeping your assets secure.

Announced today, Microsoft is looking to extend the baseline security for your operation by making Azure AD single sign-on “free” for an unlimited number of cloud apps; the company has removed the limit on the number of apps each user can be assigned for SSO access in Azure AD.]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[In .NET, the relationship between Dispose() and finalizers is confusing. In this post, we take a look at the Dispose pattern, the snowball effect of the pattern and why the pattern is broken. Then, we take a look at one of the solutions, namely, SafeHandles.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[The extent of this post is generally targeting the whole ORM families running in various technology stacks. But I will limit the explanation to only .NET (C# or VB) and will write the samples in C#.

I am the author of RepoDb and most samples could be specifics to this ORM, but again, the rationale of this post is beyond the technology stacks and libraries you preferred to work with. Think of all the samples as a code for your favorite ORM (ie: Entity Framework, NHibernate, LLBLGen or Dapper).]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[We’re pleased to introduce the first preview of Source Generators, a new C# compiler feature that lets C# developers inspect user code and generate new C# source files that can be added to a compilation. This is done via a new kind of component that we’re calling a Source Generator.

To get started with Source Generators, you’ll need to install the latest .NET 5 preview and the latest Visual Studio preview.]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Have you ever dealt with RPC? It stands for Remote Procedure Call, a famous term from distributed computing for when you need to call a service routine from one machine to another. It’s like the basics for anyone who wishes to create REST/SOAP requests or GraphQL architectures. You need to understand a bunch of concepts like parallelism, clusters, network latency, failover, and fallbacks, just to get started.]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[In the quest to migrate to .NET Core, the first step at the time (a couple of years ago) was to start migrating to ASP.NET Core from using Katana (Owin). This seemed like a logical first step as ASP.NET Core 2.x could run on .NET Framework as well as .NET Core. Ultimately this was a good first step in our migration.]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Microsoft Build 2020 is upon us, registration is open NOW. Stop reading this blog post and go register. I'll wait here.

Done? Sweet.

It's not the Build we thought it would be, but it's gonna be special. It's BUILD. Marketing says not to use ALL CAPS because it's Microsoft Build for them. For me, it's BUILD. It's BUILD at HOME. It's BUILD for YOU. It's BUILD for US. It's VIRTUAL BUILD.

A ton of folks are working hard to make Microsoft Build 2020 something special when it kinda feels like there's not a lot of special stuff happening.

It needs to be about humans as much as tech. More than tech. We build (BUILD!) stuff for each other - that's the whole point and sometimes it takes a situation like the one we're in to be reminded of that.

What are we building for you this year?]]></content:encoded>
