            <content:encoded><![CDATA[It’s possible, though quite difficult, to create neural networks from raw code. Luckily, there are many open source code libraries you can use to speed up the process. These libraries include CNTK (Microsoft), TensorFlow (Google) and scikit-learn. Most neural network libraries are written in C++ for performance but have a Python API for convenience.

In this article I’ll show you how to get started with the popular PyTorch library. Compared to many other neural network libraries, PyTorch operates at a lower level of abstraction. This gives you more control over your code and allows you to customize more easily, at the expense of having to write additional code.]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[In this article, we will learn how to deploy a Blazor application on Firebase. We will create a client side application using Blazor and host it on Firebase. This application will not have any server side code or web API logic. We will use Visual Studio 2017 to build and publish the application.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Most of the time a regular .NET developer uses object references and it is simple enough because this is how a managed world is constructed – objects are referencing each other via object references. An object reference is, in fact, a type-safe pointer (address) that always points to an object MethodTable reference field (it is often said it points at the beginning of an object). Thus, using them may be quite efficient. Having an object reference, we simply have the whole object address. For example, the GC can quickly access its header via constant offset. Addresses of fields are also easily computable due to information stored in MethodTable.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Regular readers of this column will know that I do a lot of work with Entity Framework (EF) and the newer EF Core, and that also I’m a big fan of Azure Cosmos DB. At first glance, you might think that an Object Relational Mapper (ORM) and a document database such as Cosmos DB would have nothing to do with one another. ORMs are designed to solve the problem of mapping objects to relational databases. With a document database or other type of NoSQL databases, you can just store objects and graphs of objects as JSON and not have to worry about the constraints of a relational database. So why would I, or the EF team or other developers be putting the two together?
