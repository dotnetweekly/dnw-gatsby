            <content:encoded><![CDATA[This year marks 30 years since the Continuous Integration (CI) practice was proposed by Grady Booch in 1991 in the scope of object-oriented software development. Continuous Integration aims at developing and integrating software artifacts in an incremental way by merging all code changes into a shared repository as often as possible. ]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Our recent speed comparison of major headless browser automation tools, namely Puppeteer, Playwright and WebDriverIO with DevTools and Selenium, received a very positive response. The single most common ask from our readers was that we follow up by including Cypress in our benchmark. In this article, we are doing just that - with some precautions.]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Hi and welcome to the second episode of the .NET GC internals! Yesterday is was 1.5h of talking about the (non-concurrent) Mark phase. The one responsible for discovering which object are “reachable” and which may be garbage collected. I’ve covered topics like object graph traversal algorithm, the pinning and marking flag, the mark stack and mark list data structures. And obviously, some deep dive into the gc.cpp at the end.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[The Solorigate supply chain attack has captured the focus of the world over the last month. This attack was simultaneously sophisticated and ordinary. The actor demonstrated sophistication in the breadth of tactics used to penetrate, expand across, and persist in affected infrastructure, but many of the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) were individually ordinary.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[In 2020 I developed a sizeable code base for an online restaurant REST API. In the spirit of outside-in TDD, I found it best to test the HTTP behaviour of the API by actually interacting with it via HTTP.

Sometimes ASP.NET offers more than one way to achieve the same end result. For example, to return 200 OK, you can use both OkObjectResult and ObjectResult. I don't want my tests to be coupled to such implementation details, so by testing an API via HTTP instead of using the ASP.NET object model, I decouple the two.

You can easily self-host an ASP.NET web API and test it using an HttpClient. In this article, I'll show you how I went about it.]]></content:encoded>
