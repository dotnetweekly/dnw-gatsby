            <content:encoded><![CDATA[This post shows how to use encrypted access tokens with Azure AD App registrations using Microsoft.Identity.Web. By using encrypted access tokens, only applications with access to the private key can decrypt the tokens. When using encrypted tokens, you can prevent access tokens data being used or read by such tools as https://jwt.ms or https://jwt.io and prevent the payload claims being read.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[‘Load Balancing’ is here the distribution (e.g. web requests) based on defined criteria (e.g. user location, resource utilization or round robin) to achieve a goal, e.g. avoid overloading or in case of a disaster to increase availability by automatically failing over to a redundant component.

Please also look at the decision tree for when to use what.

We will start with the regional services followed by the global services.]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Developing games is multi-disciplined compared to developing business apps and services. Games need design skills spanning UI, audio, gameplay, and art direction. It also requires engineering skills for graphics, gameplay, audio, cloud services, and develops. Sometimes you need to get low level and play around with hardware registries in assembly to optimize performance for a specific device. Do you need to build all those layers yourself when making a game, or is there a better way? Of course, there is a better way. The .NET ecosystem offers many choices for folks like you who want to make games, but do not want to build everything from scratch. In my previous post, I showcased the diverse .NET game development landscape. In this post I will showcase some of the .NET game engines out there, and will help you choose which game engine is right for you.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[This blog post continues the series which is a guide through the code analyzers available on the market and their possibilities. I’m trying to help you answer the question: “Which analyzer package should I use and how to configure it to avoid problems related to async/await?". In the previous episode, I presented the first seven most common code smells related to asynchronous programming. Today, I present the next seven traps from this area. Lucky you, they can be easily avoided with an appropriate analyzer - for every issue, I provide entries for .editorconfig that configure analyzers that can detect it. Links to NuGet packages, as well as a complete list of analyzers’ rules, can be found in the previous article.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[One of the most common problems when running automated end-to-end tests for a web application is how to handle test data. End-to-end tests often create, update, and delete all kinds of information as it goes through your test cases in the application. Inevitably, you'll run into problems because previous test runs leave behind a trail of stale data that may interfere with your current test execution.]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[In this video, we learn how about dynamically invoking a generic method with reflection in .NET C#.

When using a generic method, the generic argument (often referred to as `T`) must be provided as a known type at compile time. However, sometimes you may have a scenario where you must call a generic method using a type that it not known until run time. This can be problematic and usually results in using a large number of if/else statements.]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Hi All! Welcome back to part 11 of our Blazor 2d Gamedev series. Today we’re going to refactor and improve the code responsible of loading assets. Our goal is to have a centralized asset loading mechanism and avoid the hassle of having to reference all our assets in a Blazor page or component.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Well. It has been a while since I wanted to write this post but I couldn’t find any relevant code example to illustrate it. As you might have guessed C# 9 now allows attributes on local functions (as well as parameter attributes of local functions). To illustrate this I will show you how to use the Conditional attribute to perform conditional local function executions, for example, depending on the environment in which we are running our program. Applying it to local functions can be interesting in this case, however I admit that for the moment it is the only relevant example but it does not matter it is not necessarily the functionality of C# 9 either. more popular now. Finally we will compare with the C# 9 forward to finish our example.]]></content:encoded>
