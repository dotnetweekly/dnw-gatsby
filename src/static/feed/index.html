            <content:encoded><![CDATA[The meteoric rise of front-end frameworks like React, Angular, Vue.js, Elm, etc. has made single-page applications ubiquitous on the web. For many developers, these have become part of their ‘default’ toolset. When they start a new project, they grab the tools they know already: a REST API on the backend, and a React/Angular/Vue/Elm frontend.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[LINQ is awesome, right? It’s one of those things everyone loves from first sight. Like smartphones in the early days – you just know it’s right.

For this post, I’ll assume you already know LINQ, use it and love it.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Recently a client called me about an issue where one of their production servers would run out of memory, every other week.

The application in question was a .NET Framework 4.5 Windows service, that runs in an Azure VM, and ever so often it would become unstable and start causing trouble.

I have previously helped this client set up an ELK stack, so it was quick for me to go into Kibana, look at metricbeat data, and see that their server indeed slowly was eating up memory over time. And every time the application was restarted, the memory would return to normal, and slowly creep upwards again.]]></content:encoded>
