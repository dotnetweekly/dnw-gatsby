            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Tailwind CSS is self-described as a utility first CSS framework.

Channel<T> was included in .NET Core 3.0 (so it's been available for a bit over a year now).

In the case you never heard about it, a URL shortener is a web service that allows to redirect users accessing a short URL to a longer one. This service is very useful in many scenarios.

Apart from shortening URLs, you can imagine having several short URLs redirecting to the same target URL and then give each of the short ones to different users, this might be helpful to know which of the users accessed the final URL. It might also be helpful when sharing web content in different social networks, you might use one short URL to share in Instagram, another different in Facebook and so on, all of them targeting the same destination URL helping you to get stats on where your shared content have more audience. These are only a few among the large advantages this services have.]]></content:encoded>
