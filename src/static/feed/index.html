            <content:encoded><![CDATA[The development of client-side Blazor leveraging WebAssembly -- appropriately called Blazor WebAssembly -- has suffered a few hiccups, but Microsoft has big plans for the red-hot technology that enables C# Web development.

As detailed in a .NET Conf presentation this week, those plans include more native-focused projects, including Progressive Web Apps (PWAs), hybrid apps and desktop apps via Electron. The company is also investigating Blazor Native -- and there's even an individual experiment demo that uses Blazor to create Flutter apps. These are all possible because the default renderer in Blazor -- for Web -- can be replaced with other renderers.]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[This is the seventh article in our series about building microservices on .NET Core. In the first article we introduced the series and prepared the plan: business case and solution architecture. In the second article we described how you can structure internal architecture of one microservice using CQRS pattern and MediatR library. In the third article we described the importance of service discovery in microservice based architecture and presented practical implementation with Eureka. In the fourth part we presented how you can build API Gateways for your microservices with Ocelot. Fifth part was dedicated to implementation of data access with Marten library. In the last article we showed you how you can combine SignalR and RabbitMQ to build real time server-client communication. Source code for complete solution can be found on our GitHub.

It is quite popular nowadays, especially if you own your own infrastructure, private cloud or just cannot store your secrets using Key Vault services provided by Azure/AWS/GCP.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Viewport units in CSS sound great. If you want to style an element to take up the full screen height, you can just set height: 100vh and voila - you have a perfect fullscreen element, which resizes as the viewport changes! Sadly, this is not the case. 100vh is broken in a subtle but fundamental way on mobile browsers that makes it nearly useless. It’s best to avoid 100vh and instead rely on javascript to set heights for a full viewport experience.

The core issue is that mobile browsers (I’m looking at you, Chrome and Safari) have a “helpful” feature where the address bar is sometimes visible and sometimes hidden, changing the visible size of the viewport. Rather than adjusting the height of 100vh to be the visible portion of the screen as the viewport height changes, these browsers instead have 100vh set to the height of the browser with address the address bar hidden. The result is that the bottom portion of the screen will be cut off when the address bar is visible, thus defeating the purpose of 100vh to begin with.]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[If we built this city on rock an’ roll (and my sources on this are as incontrovertible as Starship and Mannequin 2: On The Move), then we built this web on content. HTML was one of the foundational technologies behind the web from day one and it is essentially a means of formatting documents to be served on the internet. Documents, of course, are of no more value than the content they contain.

Today, we like to talk a lot about building web applications, but content is still the foundation to the majority of the web. Managing that content in the early days was simple, but, since then, the tools we use to create and manage content across the web have evolved to a degree that they have almost come full circle. In this post, I want to look at the evolution of web content management from the early days of the web to the headless, cloud-based CMS systems of today.]]></content:encoded>

            <pubDate>Thu, 10 Oct 2019 16:56:18 GMT</pubDate>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Sometimes it’s hard to tell when the newest web design trend will be worth adopting or when it’s just a passing fad we shouldn’t invest too much time or energy in. Progressive web apps (PWAs), for instance, had that problem in the beginning, which is why most content written about them focused on explaining what they were.

Today, though, we don’t need to be educated on what a PWA is or why it’s a more valuable mobile asset than a mobile responsive website.

PWAs are inherently fast and secure. Plus, they’re a great option for anyone who wants to leverage the good stuff from native mobile apps (like offline caching and telephony integrations) while improving upon their weaknesses (like battery and storage consumption and sharing capabilities).]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[In my last blog I explained how your pa$$word doesn’t matter - but multi-factor authentication (MFA) does! Several folks commented that “MFA isn’t a panacea.” That’s true in targeted attacks when attackers are willing to invest enough to break MFA, and there’s no easier way.

Let’s not get crazy - Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) is the least you can do if you are at all serious about protecting your accounts. Use of anything beyond the password significantly increases the costs for attackers, which is why the rate of compromise of accounts using any type of MFA is less than 0.1% of the general population.]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Windows Virtual Desktop is now released and ready for production! On today's show, Scott Manchester demonstrates WVD at general availability and what's coming. We'll show what the WVD team is doing to revolutionize app delivery with App Attach. This is a new way to deliver apps to WVD virtual machines without installing or streaming app binaries into VMs, but instead attaching to MSIX-based app packages stored in file shares - so they 'feel' installed to Windows and appear and work as if installed to WVD users. We also show AV redirect in Microsoft Teams, to optimize video and audio delivery between clients, by eliminating 'hops' normally needed to encode and decode AV streams between clients and VMs. Finally, using Azure NetApp Files, we'll show you an easy way to lift-and-shift file share volumes directly into Azure, so they retain file and folder permissions, paths, and classic manageability.]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Two weeks ago .NET Core 3.0 was officially published. Together with the new framework version, Visual Studio 2019 got support for a long-awaited C# 8.0. The complete list of the new language features is available [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-US/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-8) on the MSDN, but the one that deserves special attention is [Nullable reference types](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-US/dotnet/csharp/whats-new/csharp-8#nullable-reference-types). This is a very important change in the language semantic because from now we will be able to eliminate certain class of errors related to reference `nullability` on the compilation stage. In this blog post, I will show you how to use this new language feature and how to achieve similar benefits if you still cannot use .NET Core 3.0 in your projects.]]></content:encoded>

.NET Core was initially created to allow for the next generation of ASP.NET solutions but now drives and is the basis for many other scenarios including IoT, cloud and next generation mobile solutions. Version 3 adds a number of oft-requested features such as support for WinForms, WPF and Entity Framework 6.

In this series we will explore some more of the benefits of .NET Core and how it can benefit not only traditional .NET developers but all technologists that need to bring robust, performant and economical solutions to market.]]></content:encoded>
