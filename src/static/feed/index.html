            <content:encoded><![CDATA[.NET for Apache Spark provides high performance APIs for using Apache Spark from C# and F#. With these .NET APIs, you can access the most popular Dataframe and SparkSQL aspects of Apache Spark, for working with structured data, and Spark Structured Streaming, for working with streaming data.

.NET for Apache Spark is compliant with .NET Standard - a formal specification of .NET APIs that are common across .NET implementations. This means you can use .NET for Apache Spark anywhere you write .NET code allowing you to reuse all the knowledge, skills, code, and libraries you already have as a .NET developer.

.NET for Apache Spark runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS using .NET Core, or Windows using .NET Framework. It also runs on all major cloud providers including Azure HDInsight Spark, Amazon EMR Spark, AWS & Azure Databricks.

Note: We currently have a Spark Project Improvement Proposal JIRA at SPIP: .NET bindings for Apache Spark to work with the community towards getting .NET support by default into Apache Spark. We highly encourage you to participate in the discussion.]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[One nice feature that NHibernate has is future results. It is technically a capability to put queries on hold until data is actually asked. When data is asked from one delayed query then all queries are sent to database server as one batch and results are read also as one batch of multiple result sets. This blog post explains how to use future results with NHibernate.]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[I have a dirty little secret to admit, and I hope you don’t think less of me for saying so. I have never localized any application that I’ve ever built. Phew, I feel better getting that off my chest. I like to think it’s something we’ve all done.

We start our projects with the best intentions of helping as many users as possible, only to hardcode our labels, messages, and documentation. It begins innocently enough, “I’ll just hardcode it for now and come back to it later.” We never come back to “it”. Now we’ve limited the number of potential users we can help because we only target our native tongue.

In this post, we’ll see how straightforward it is to add localization to any .NET application. Our code will be more readable, appeal to a broader userbase, and we’ll be better developers for taking the extra step of localization.]]></content:encoded>

Setup Azure DevOps project and git Repo

Open the required Azure DevOps project, or create a new Azure DevOps project. Add a Pipeline build. This demo will create a Nuget package from a .NET Standard library using .NET Core. The yml file is created and added to the git source code.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[OpenID Connect is an authentication layer built on top of OAuth 2.0, which means that you have to use one of the OAuth 2.0 authorization flows. A few years ago, there were basically two possible flows that you could use in a desktop client application to authenticate a user:

Resource Owner Password Credentials
Authorization Code
The password flow is pretty easy to use (basically, just exchange the user’s login and password for a token), but it requires that the client app is highly trusted, since it gets to manipulate the user’s credentials directly. This flow is now disallowed by OAuth 2.0 Security Best Current Practice.]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[When you are building any kind of application it's typical to want to store information which persists beyond a single user session. Sometimes that will be information that you'll want to live in some kind of centralised database, but not always.

Also, you may want that data to still be available if your user is offline. Even if they can't connect to the network, the user may still be able to use the app to do meaningful tasks; but the app will likely require a certain amount of data to drive that.

How can we achieve this in the context of a PWA?
