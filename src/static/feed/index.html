            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Purpose of this repository
This is list of main goals of this repository:

Showing how you can implement the monolith application in a modular way
Presentation of the full implementation of the application. This is not another simple application. This is not another proof of concept (PoC). The assumption is to present the implementation of the application that would be ready to run on production
Showing the application of best practices and object-oriented programming principles
Presentation of the use of design patterns. When, how and why they can be used
Presentation of some architectural considerations, decisions, approaches
Presentation of the implementation using Domain-Driven Design approach (tactical patterns)]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[I don't believe that the web development community is having an honest discussion about GraphQL. This is because, GraphQL is almost exclusively presented as an alternative to REST (Representational State Transfer). And, while GraphQL may remove points-of-friction found in REST, the dishonesty is rooted in a false and implicit dichotomy when it comes to API implementations. The truth is, GraphQL and REST are not your only choices when it comes to building an HTTP-based API. And while this may be obvious to many experienced web application developers, it is not nearly as obvious to newcomers. As such, I think that the community should be striving to have a more nuanced conversation.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[One of the great extensibility points in the routing feature of the older versions of the ASP.NET MVC and ASP.NET Core MVC frameworks was the ability to pick up any route and dynamically point it at a given controller/action.

This had a lot of excellent use cases – as we will briefly see – and since ASP.NET Core 3.0 Preview 7, the feature is actually finally available in ASP.NET Core 3.0 (despite not being mentioned in the official release blog post).

So, let’s have a look at dynamic routing in ASP.NET Core 3.0 together!]]></content:encoded>

Part 1 - Exploring the new project file, Program.cs, and the generic host (this post)
Part 2 - Comparing Startup.cs between the ASP.NET Core 3.0 templates
In this post I take a look at some of the fundamental pieces of ASP.NET Core 3.0 applications - the .csproj project file and the Program.cs file. I'll describe how they've changed in the default templates from ASP.NET Core 2.x, and discuss some of the changes in the the APIs they use.]]></content:encoded>

Website performance: Why and how to measure?
Website performance: How I've improved the performance of this website? (this post)
In the previous post, I wrote about why performance is important and how to measure it for your website. In this post, I'll talk about the different things I've made on this website to improve the performance. Some of the optimizations are just some configuration flags to turn on, others require more changes in your code.]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[In my last post, I introduced you to a tool for looking up licenses of .NET projects called delice.

This week I released the first update, version 1.1.0, that brings a big improvement to the license detection for the legacy licensing format of many NuGet packages.

Determine Licenses via the GitHub API
By-and-large the dependencies we rely on are the output of an OSS project and that project is more often than not hosted on GitHub. Because of this, we can use the GitHub License API to try and get the license information of a project, which delice now supports:

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Single Page Applications are the new wave of the moment. In the midst of several frameworks and libraries that arose during the last decade to tackle better ways to build web applications, React is now the most popular one. It’s a lightweight library (yes, React is not a framework, so it means it doesn’t come with all the rules, specifications and patterns that Angular, e.g., comes with), that is embraced and powered by the community, simple to use, flexible, and relies on a strong concept: components.
