            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Recently, I migrated a web API from .NET Core 2.2 to version 3.0 (following the documentation by Microsoft). After that, the API worked fine without changes to the (WPF) client or the controller code on the server – except for one function that looked a bit like this (simplified naming, obviously).

The Thing class has an Items property of type List<Item>, the Item class has a SubItems property of type List<SubItem>.
What I didn’t expect was that after the migration, all SubItems lists were empty, while the Items lists contained, well, items.
But it worked before! I didn’t change anything!

In fact, I didn’t touch my code, but something else changed: ASP.NET Core no longer uses Json.NET by NewtonSoft. Instead, JSON serialization is done by classes in the new System.Text.Json namespace.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[It’s been a busy time for .NET Core – we just shipped 3.0, and are currently working on a few updates for v3.1 (due in November.) As we turn our attention to .NET Core 5.0, we want to take a step back and see what you are doing with .NET Core and how we can make it even better.

We have put together a quick survey that will help us understand our customer base a bit better, how you are using .NET core, and what we can do to improve it. So please head over to Survey Monkey and help shape the future of .NET Core.

Surveys help give us a breadth view of .NET Core users, but we also want to understand in more depth what challenges you face in your projects, so if you are willing to participate in more detailed feedback, please provide your contact details in the survey.

Thank you for your contribution.]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[In a follow up to our previous episode on Supercharging your Web APIs with OData and ASP.NET Core, Hassan is back with Jeremy to talk about how we can customize the OData entity model so that we can use OData with any data source. Along the way, there might be a little Blazor goodness too!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[It is remarkable to see the transformation over the last few years as more and more developers build scalable, cloud native applications, taking advantage of managed services to deploy and run them. With this transformation, microservice architectures have become the standard for building cloud native applications, and it is predicted that by 2022, 90% of new apps will feature microservice architectures. A microservice architecture offers compelling benefits, including scalability, loose service coupling and independent deployments. However, this approach can come at a high cost of understanding and skilling on distributed systems.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[TLDR; I wanted to know what the fastest vector types were on .NET. Turns out, performance varies wildly across platforms. System.Numerics.Vector4 and friends give good performance overall, especially for .NET Core apps, while homemade vector types do not get auto-vectorized. Avoid Vector<T> like the plague. Oh, and iPhone 11s are stupid fast.]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[In the battle over cloud providers, the bid for the United States Department of Defense (DoD) Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure (JEDI) contract is a big deal. The DoD released on October 25, 2019 that they are awarding the JEDI contract worth up-to $10 Billion ($10,000,000,000) over the next 10 years to Microsoft. They have ultimately chosen Microsoft, and Microsoft Azure, as the cloud of choice to standardize on a single cloud vendor to build out their enterprise cloud.
