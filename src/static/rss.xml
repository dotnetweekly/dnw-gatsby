            <content:encoded><![CDATA[According to StackOverflow, C# is one of the most-loved programming languages. And I completely understand that—it is powerful, easy to learn and consistently improving and developing. It is a living language. :)

The last couple of years, there were new features added to the languages, and the new versions keep coming up—C# 7, C# 8, C# 9.

As you know, we at Progress Telerik are proud that our products are always in sync with the latest things in the .NET world, and C# 9 and JustMock are no exception.]]></content:encoded>
