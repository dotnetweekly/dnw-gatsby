            <content:encoded><![CDATA[This blog post is about containerizing an ASP.NET Core Application with SQL Server. In this blog post I will explain how to run the migrations as part of the deployment process.

In this post I am building an ASP.NET Core Web API application and I have enabled Swagger for testing purposes. I have added a Dockerfile and docker-compose.yaml file using Visual Studio code.

Here is the Dockerfile I generated using Docker extension VS Code.]]></content:encoded>
