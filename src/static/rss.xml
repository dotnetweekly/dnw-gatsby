            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Azure Storage Account is one of the foundation services of Azure. Pretty much all other services use it under the cover in a way or another. This service is simple, works great, and has crazy SLA and redundancy capabilities. However, it doesn't provide a point in time restore. Meaning that if you corrupt or delete some data, there's no way to recover it. There are some solutions that you can find over the internet, but unfortunately, none of them is a silver bullet. Let's explore and compare some of them.]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[If youâ€™ve ever taken part in an AI challenge or contest over the years, youâ€™ve probably had to work out a path finding algorithm along the way. I remember many moons ago, as part of the Google AI Challenge (ended a few years ago which is a real shame), I actually swapped my solution to use Java just so I could use an A* search algorithm that I found on the internet. C# can be a bit weird in that for business applications, you can find a million examples on how to talk to Sharepoint, but when it comes to AI, Machine Learning, or even just data structures and algorithms in general, it can be a bit bare. So I thought I would quickly whip up a post on a dead simple implementation of the A* path finding algorithm in C#.
