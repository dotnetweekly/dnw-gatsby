            <content:encoded><![CDATA[This repo highlights the list of software engineering guidelines in general. Most of these are industry-wise conventions, thus using them will ensure that your code is easily readable by people who are not you.

It's a fact that coding standards are arbitrary. The key to a successful maintainable project, however, is not which standards you follow, but that you are consistent.]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Container-based application deployment and execution has become very common. Nearly all cloud and server app developers we talk to use containers in some way. We mostly hear about public cloud use, but also IoT and have even heard of .NET containers pulled and used over satellite links on cruise ships. In the early days, we would share compelling reasons why people should consider containers. We no longer do that because containers are so widely used now. We are focused on making .NET a great container platform, and adapting as the container ecosystem evolves.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Let’s talk shadows in web design. Shadows add texture, perspective, and emphasize the dimensions of objects. In web design, using light and shadow can add physical realism and can be used to make rich, tactile interfaces.

Take the landing page below. It is for cycling tours in Iceland. Notice the embellished drop shadow of the cyclist and how it creates the perception that they are flying above not only the content on the page, but the page itself, as though they are “popping” over the screen. It feels dynamic and immediate, which is perfect for the theme of adventure.]]></content:encoded>
