            <content:encoded><![CDATA[gRPC is a modern open source RPC framework created by Google. It is based on Googleâ€™s modern Protocol Buffer serialization engine but is not tied to it. C# developers who have used WCF in the past, or anyone building C# backend services should take a look at this. gRPC has most of the functionality that WCF has, but you can build on .NET Core. This article will introduce gRPC, explain why WCF developers should pay attention, and talk about why it could be used for any service. According to Scott Hunter at Microsoft:

If you are a remoting or WCF Server developer and want to build a new application on .NET Core, we would recommend either ASP.NET Core Web APIs or gRPC

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[This is my personal collection of notes, scripts and techniques developed to help debug live .NET Core applications.
