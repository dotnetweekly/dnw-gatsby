            <content:encoded><![CDATA[This article shows how to create and issue verifiable credentials using MATTR and an ASP.NET Core. The ASP.NET Core application allows an admin user to create an OIDC credential issuer using the MATTR service. The credentials are displayed in an ASP.NET Core Razor Page web UI as a QR code for the users of the application. The user can use a digital wallet form MATTR to scan the QR code, authenticate against an Auth0 identity provider configured for this flow and use the claims from the id token to add the verified credential to the digital wallet. In a follow up post, a second application will then use the verified credentials to allow access to a second business process.

- k6: When Unit Tests Meet Load Testing

Perhaps the greatest differentiator of k6 is that it bridges the gap between unit testing and load testing. Developers can use the same workflow theyâ€™ve been using for years: creating tests, adding verifications with pass/fail criteria, adding those to the CI/CD pipeline, and then be notified when the tests do fail.]]></content:encoded>
