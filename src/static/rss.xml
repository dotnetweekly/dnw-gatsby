            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Three years ago, we launched the Microsoft Professional Program (MPP) with one mission: to help you build the technical skills you need to succeed in emerging jobs.

Since that time, the importance of technical skills and industry-recognized certifications has grown.

Research tells us that:

Certified new hires reach full productivity sooner and find more opportunities for advancement.
Certified employees earn 15 percent more than those without certification.
Employees with certifications are nearly 20 percent more productive.
Thatâ€™s why weâ€™ve decided to evolve our approach into a program where you can work toward a technical certification. How?

To help you succeed, we have created Microsoft Learnâ€”a free, interactive way of learning that helps you prepare for certifications. It combines short step-by-step tutorials, interactive browser-based coding/scripting environments, and task-based achievements.

As we retire MPP, Microsoft Learn becomes your destination for building the skills you need to be successful.]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Web accessibility and usability are closely related, but the two terms are quite different. Although theyâ€™re commonly used interchangeably, itâ€™s important to understand the differences between the two terms. In order to do so, we must establish the link between web accessibility and usability while outlining what makes each term unique. Letâ€™s start off with looking at web accessibility and what it means.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Deep Neural Networks Training (PREVIEW) (#4057)
Introduces in-preview 0.15.1 Microsoft.ML.DNN package that enables full DNN model retraining and transfer learning in .NET using C# bindings for tensorflow provided by Tensorflow .NET. The goal of this package is to allow high level DNN training and scoring tasks such as image classification, text classification, object detection, etc using simple yet powerful APIs that are framework agnostic but currently they only uses Tensorflow as the backend. The below APIs are in early preview and we hope to get customer feedback that we can incorporate in the next iteration.]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[To pass a certification exam and earn a Microsoft certification requires being prepared and knowing the content being tested. This can come from experience using the technologies, however, this doesnâ€™t get you 100% of the way to passing through experience alone. Often you donâ€™t use all the technologies and do all the tasks covered on the exam through your daily job duties. As a result, you will need to study.

The keys to preparing for Microsoft certification exams are finding all the right study tools and materials necessary for your learning style. It also helps to go through a practice test of some kind to help prepare and really drill in the memorization of the technical knowledge required.]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[On Thursday, August 8, 2019, GitHub announced the preview of GitHub Actions with support for Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD). Actions makes it possible to create simple, yet powerful pipelines and automate software compilation and delivery. Today, we are announcing the preview of GitHub Actions for Azure.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[One of the most important concepts in modern programming is Exceptions. They were introduced in the 60â€™s with LISP and eventually made their way to practically all modern programming languages.

The simple concept is this: When some kind of error occurs during runtime, the execution will terminate and an Exception will be thrown. This will cause the stack to unwind until an appropriate Exception Handler is found. Itâ€™s a brilliant concept really. ]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[If you are interested in Vue.js, you probably know about the 3rd version of this framework, which will be released shortly (if you are reading this article from the future, I hope itâ€™s still relevant ðŸ˜‰). The new version is under active development for now, but all possible features can be found in separate RFC (request for comments) repository: https://github.com/vuejs/rfcs. One of them, function-api, can dramatically change the style of developing Vue apps.]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[SRP is a principle that cannot be easily inferred from its definition. Moreover the SRP lets a lot of room for own opinions and interpretations. So what is SRP about? SRP is about logic partitioning into code: which logic should be declared in which class. Something to keep in mind is that SRP is the only SOLID principle not related to the usage of abstraction and polymorphism.

The goal of this post is to propose objective and concrete guidelines to increase your classes compliance with SRP, and in-fine, increase the maintainability of your code.]]></content:encoded>
