            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Starting with .NET Core 2.1 Microsoft introduced the Dotnet Tools platform as part of the .NET Core SDK and since then these tools have become a vital although underutilized part of the .NET Eco system.

Dotnet Tools are a simple way to create, publish and consume what are essentially .NET Core applications that can be published and shared using the existing NuGet infrastructure for packaging and distribution. This means it's really quick and easy to build tools that you can share either publicly or privately.]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Prometheus is an open source monitoring solution that collects metrics from the system and its applications. As a developer, you can query these metrics and use them to create alerts, which you can use as a source for dashboards. One example would be using Prometheus metrics with Grafana.

In this article, I show you how to use Prometheus to monitor a .NET Core application running on Kubernetes. Note that installation instructions are not included with the article. I do include a reference for using the Prometheus Operator to create and configure Prometheus on Kubernetes.]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[As a web developer, I have fully embraced the idea that to extract pure performance out of our web applications we need to reduce the amount of time that a server needs to churn on request. Statically generated web sites really scratch that itch.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Letâ€™s start with the reason why any cloud is a cheaper option than others: Economies of Scale. Economy of scale is the ability to reduce costs and gain efficiency when operating at a larger scale in comparison to operating at a smaller scale. Cloud services offer high availability, fault tolerance, agility, scalability, elasticity, global reach, disaster recovery, security and lots more.

It involves moving away from CapEx (Capital expenditure â€” server / storage / network upfront costs) into OpEx ( Operational Expenditure â€” deductible expense on cloud services used). The following diagram shows how with CapEx you are always playing catch up and are either under-provisioned or over-provisioned most of the time, whereas with OpEx model you depend on a cloud service to autoscale (up or down) and then pay the appropriate costs for rendered services later (no upfront costs).]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.dotnetweekly.com/articles/shifting-from-expressjs-to-azure-functions</guid>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[Express.js is one of the most popular Node.js frameworks for web developers and remains an excellent choice for building apps that serve API endpoints.

When migrating code to a serverless architecture, refactoring Express.js endpoints affects the following areas:

Middleware: Express.js features a robust collection of middleware. Many middleware modules are no longer required in light of Azure Functions and Azure API Management capabilities. Ensure you can replicate or replace any logic handled by essential middleware before migrating endpoints.

Differing APIs: The API used to process both requests and responses differs among Azure Functions and Express.js. The following example details the required changes.

Default route: By default, Azure Functions endpoints are exposed under the api route. Routing rules are configurable via routePrefix in the host.json file.

Configuration and conventions: A Functions app uses the function.json file to define HTTP verbs, define security policies, and can configure the function's input and output. By default, the folder name that which contains the function files defines the endpoint name, but you can change the name via the route property in the function.json file.]]></content:encoded>
